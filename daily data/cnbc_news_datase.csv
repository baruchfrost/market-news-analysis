1,My take on the early Brexit winners and losers,2016-06-24T13:50:48-0400,,"This commentary originally ran on Facebook. Boris Johnson – The former London mayor and grudging ""Leave"" supporter-turned enthusiastic ""Leave"" leader chose the winning side. He's now a front-runner to lead the Tory party. ‪#‎HellFreezesOver‬ Theresa May – Boris Johnson's populist approach to the Brexit campaign ticked off quite a few Tory elders, so the real money should be on UK Home Secretary Theresa May to succeed outgoing Prime Minister David Cameron. May is a political heavyweight and is generally respected among the Tories, something Boris Johnson is … um, not.  Nigel Farage – the once-embattled UK Independence Party leader gets his moment in the sun. Also gets to keep having a political career. And the fact that he quoted ""Independence Day"" in his victory speech made a crazy night that much crazier.  Marine Le Pen/Geert Wilders – Charismatic figures with a long history agitating for EU exits, France's Marine Le Pen and the Netherlands' Geert Wilders wasted no time calling for their own referendums. Brexit legitimizes their years of saber-rattling, and moves them from the political fringes into the mainstream, where they can do serious damage to the European project.  Vladimir Putin – Russia's strongman needed this. Low oil prices have leveled the Russian economy, and the International Olympic Committee has banned Russian track athletes from competing at ‪#‎Rio2016‬. But now he gets to say ""at least we're not Europe.""  Nicola Sturgeon – The head of the Scottish National Party delivered on her end from Scotland, where 62 percent of Scots voted to ""Remain,"" though turnout wasn't as high as hoped. She now has political leverage by threatening to hold another Scottish referendum. And if Scotland leaves, the British drought at Wimbledon gets retroactively reinstated.  German/US relations – Going to get stronger. By default.  David Cameron – The man called the referendum to keep Euroskeptic Tories from defecting to the UK Independence Party camp in last year's parliamentary election. That turns out to have bought him an extra year in 10 Downing Street. Hope it was worth it, David. ‪#‎KarmaIsABitch‬   British pollsters – whiffed on the Scottish referendum. Whiffed on last year's parliamentary elections. Whiffed on the Brexit referendum. We were better off flipping a coin.   Alexis Tsipras – when the Greek Prime Minister held a referendum on whether the Greek people should sign a deal for more austerity, he just ignored the results. The fact that Cameron actually fell on his referendum sword makes Tsipras look silly. Oh, and Grexit is now a real possibility now that the precedent has been sent. Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn – Pundits have pointed to Labour's particularly poor showing to get out the vote as a key reason why the ""Remain"" side failed to win. And Jeremy Corbyn just failed in his first real test as Labour leader. Labour has some soul-searching to do, though it feels like we say that after every election.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel – Brexit is now yet another problem for Europe (read: Merkel) to deal with. As if she didn't have enough to worry over.   The British pound sterling – As the pound fell to levels not seen since 1985, maybe the first time ever that the British wish they had adopted the euro.   London's financial sector – Despite the UK's long-fraught relationship with the EU, it was clearly a net benefit for London's financial sector, which could lay claim as the financial center of Europe. Much harder to do that when you've announced to the world you no longer want to be part of ""Europe."" Look for Frankfurt to pick up the slack.   Donald J. Trump – Would have made him a winner, except he arrived in Scotland and announced that the Scottish ""took their country back."" So many things factually incorrect in that one statement I don't even know where to begin. Still, Brexit shows that divisive politics has an audience, which could bode well for The Donald.

2,Europe&#039;s recovery depends on Renzi&#039;s Italy,2014-03-25T13:29:45-0400,,"In spring, ambitious reforms began in Italy. Under Matteo Renzi, the ailing economy will either begin a real recovery, or slide further. The outcome is vital to Italy, Europe and the global economy.   Soon the name of Matteo Renzi, the new prime minister of Italy, will be known better internationally, after his meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Obama.    Along with French President François Hollande, the two know only too well what's at stake in Italy's recovery. If it succeeds, the recovery of the euro zone will slowly continue. If not, the implications will be global. The reform drive of il Rottamatore   One year after being sworn in as Mayor of Florence in 2009, Matteo Renzi declared that a complete change was necessary in his Democratic Party and Italian politics. So he was nicknamed il Rottamatore (""The Scrapper""). Last February, the 39-year-old Renzi became the youngest person in history to be Italy's Prime Minister — even younger than Mussolini.   (Read more: France to ply China with wine)   But can the Great Scrapper reverse Italy's economic decline?   First, the good news: In the end of 2013, only two months before Renzi arrived in Rome, the longest recession in Italy's postwar history ended.    The bad news is that, after nine consecutive quarters of negative growth, the economy is almost 10 percent smaller than before the crisis. Meanwhile, business continues to complain about the tax burden, and the unemployment rate has doubled to over 12 percent since 2007. Despite pledges of austerity in Brussels and Rome, Italy's fiscal deficit is 3 percent of the GDP and its sovereign debt has climbed to more than 132 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Among the EU members, only Greece has more.    The only bright spot is the current account surplus, which is almost 1 percent of the GDP. The positive turn stems from a higher contribution from net exports, coupled with a decline in imports. Nonetheless, it will be hard for Italian exporters to sustain their performance in the near future.    The economy suffers from a de facto process of de-industrialization. Industrial production has not increased ever since August 2011 and is now down 25 percent from its peak. Credit contraction weighs heavily on business confidence and consumer sentiment.   Ambitious programs — on a monthly basis   Today, Renzi's Democratic Party, Partito Democratico (PD), has its strongest constituencies in Northern-Central Italy and the big cities. PD runs 12 Italian regions out of a total of 20. It is social-democratic, progressive by outlook, reformist by inclination.    Renzi himself is perceived as a liberal modernizer. When he became prime minister, it was a sign of much-needed generational change in the aging Italy, in which potential growth amounts to barely 0.8  to 1 percent in the coming years.    (Read more: Russia's next step: Capitol controls?)   Italy needs huge structural and institutional reforms. Renzi hopes to reverse the country's longstanding decline by launching one large project every month, starting with a new electoral law to consolidate political decision-making, reforms in the public administration, and the tax system.    Even before Italy's European Council presidency will begin on July 1, 2014, Renzi hopes to achieve on a monthly basis what Rome's political class has failed to achieve in decades. After Berlusconi's rule, he sees Italy's political landscape as devastated. Even before his premiership, he suggested that Italy's parliamentarians should vote for their own removal. To become prime minister, Renzi politically maneuvered his predecessor Enrico Letta to resign.    Nonetheless, Renzi's program will initiate the long-needed transformation of Italy. If this program will fall apart, the failure could push the economy deeper into the abyss.   Slow recovery — or devastating depression   In the past, the euro zone avoided a major crisis as long as friction points were restricted to small economies (e.g., Greece, Portugal, Ireland), which each accounted for less than 3 percent of the euro zone GDP.    Everything changed in fall 2011 when the contagion effect reached Spain and Italy, which together account for almost 30 percent of the regional GDP. If, under these circumstances, Greece would have defaulted, it could have caused a contagion effect, particularly in Italy. That is why Greece has now received two bailouts (73 billion euros and 164 billion euros), is in talks about a third one (up to 20 billion euros) and more generous repayment terms.    As long as Greece remains solvent, Italy and Spain will have time to restore sustained growth.   (Read more: ECB's Weidmann says QE not out of the question)  The Italian economy remains vulnerable, however. Standard & Poor's still has a negative outlook on the country's ""BBB"" rating. Even by 2016, Italian economic output is likely to remain nearly 7 percent below 2007 levels. It is suffering from a ""lost decade.""   The stakes are massive. Italy continues to account for 5 percent of gross commercial long-term debt globally, although its population is less than 1 percent of the world total.   While Brussels has demanded tough austerity programs, an exclusive focus on the latter would only make things worse in Italy. Instead, Renzi's government is likely to reduce its huge debt only slowly, but focus on a lower deficit.    A failure to achieve progress would polarize Italy, destabilize Southern Europe and reduce global growth prospects.   How Italy goes, so will the world go.  — By Dan Steinbock  Dan Steinbock is research director of International Business at India China and America Institute (USA), visiting fellow at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (China) and in the EU-Center (Singapore).

3,US Moves Closer to Becoming A Major Shareholder In GM,2009-04-22T19:49:03+0000,Michelle Caruso-Cabrera,"The US government is increasingly likely to convert a $13.4 billion loan to General Motors into common stock, sharply reducing the company's debt burden and giving taxpayers a major stake in the struggling auto maker, sources tell CNBC.","cnbc, Articles, General Motors Co, Business News, Transportation, Autos, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","The US government is increasingly likely to convert a $13.4 billion loan to General Motors into common stock, sharply reducing the company's debt burden and giving taxpayers a major stake in the struggling auto maker, sources tell CNBC.The move, which is still under discussion, is partly aimed at getting GM's  bondholders and the United Auto Workers union to make more concessions and avert a possible bankruptcy filing, these sources said. The government is pressuring the UAW to make concessions on GM retiree health benefits. People involved in the talks caution that nothing has been decided yet. Officials from President Obama's auto task force and the UAW had no comment.The US agreed to loan GM up to $13.4 billion in December provided the auto maker convinced bondholders and the UAW to accept much of what the company owes them in stock rather than cash. Slideshow: What's new at New York Auto ShowSo far, both groups have balked. Both the union and bondholders are worried that if they accept stock, and the company goes bankrupt anyway, they will be left with nothing. However, if the government converts its loan to equity, it signals to both groups that the White House will not let the company fail, and that the stock will eventually be worth something.GM owes the UAW $20 billion for its retiree health care benefits, and it owes bondholders $27.5 billion. Crucial to all of this: a new business plan for GM that reflects the current economic environment. That means fewer plants, fewer models, lower pay for union employees and a balance with far less, if any, debt. If that cannot be achieved, President Obama has said that forcing the company into bankruptcy is a strong possibility. Previously, GM offered the bondholders 8 cents in cash, 16 and half cents in new debt, and 90% of the company's equity. It offered the union $10 billion amortized over 20 years, and $10 billion in preferred stock with a 9% interest rate. However, the auto task force told GM those offers were too generous because of the unprecedented and precipitous decline in auto sales. Those previous offers were based on the assumption that auto sales would return to an annual pace of around 11 million cars. Thus far however, they have hovered around 9 million cars per year. As CNBC reported more than a week ago, GM is planning to offer the bondholders no cash, no new debt, and only as much as 20% of the stock of GM, perhaps even as little as 10%. Again, negotiations are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. Terms of a possible offer could change on a daily or even hourly basis.Reuters reports they are considering offering the unions only stock as well. If true, that would sit very poorly with the union, as it needs cash to pay for retiree health care benefits. Doctor visits and MRIs can't be paid for with stock. However, the union retiree benefit plan does have some cash. GM had already paid them $10 billion out of $30 billion owed to them, late last year. Some argue that would justify paying the rest that is owed to them in stock, which down the road they could sell, and use to pay retiree health care benefits.",11:24.3
4,Trump: 'Mission accomplished' on 'perfectly executed' Syria strike,2018-04-14T14:59:04+0000,Javier E. David,,"cnbc, Articles, George W. Bush, Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Chemical weapons, Syria, Politics, Europe News, World News, US: News, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","President Donald Trump hailed the U.S.-led intervention in Syria as ""perfectly executed,"" adding that the military campaign to degrade Bashar Assad's chemical weapons capability had accomplished its goals.Less than a day after U.S., British and French forces targeted suspected chemical weapons sites in retaliation to an attack that left dozens of civilians dead last week, Trump thanked the U.S. coalition partners.Yet in an echo of former president George W. Bush, Trump used words that ultimately came back to haunt his predecessor, by pronouncing ""Mission Accomplished."" That characterization raised questions about whether Western forces would intervene again if Assad used chemical weapons again, or if the conflict escalated amid Russia's growing bellicosity.""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" Trump said in a Twitter post.Defense Secretary James Mattis called the strikes a ""one time shot"" aimed at the Syrian government's chemical weapons infrastructure.""Clearly, the Assad regime did not get the message last year,"" Mattis told reporters on Friday from the Pentagon.""Together we have sent a clear message to Assad and his murderous lieutenants that they should not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable.""Back in May 2003, Bush prematurely declared the Iraq war as being over, in the wake of U.S. forces successfully toppling the government of Saddam Hussein. The event, staged on a U.S. bomber under a massive banner that screamed ""Mission Accomplished,"" overshadowed the years of conflict and bloodshed that followed.In a briefing on Saturday, Pentagon officials also described the Syria bombing as having successfully accomplished its goals. Trump's declaration came as Moscow, which is backing Syria in its long civil conflict, has denounced the bombing campaign with undisguised contempt. In the wake of Friday's strike, Russia's ambassador to the U.S. warned of ""consequences,"" while Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly called the intervention an ""act of aggression.""--CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this article.",11:24.5

They knew that these same kinds of automated cyberattacks were plaguing a wide variety of companies, leaving them unprepared when responding to a breach or, worse, preventing a future attack.Hexadite uses artificial intelligence to investigate and remediate every alert a company receives, claiming it can resolve incidents in seconds, freeing up a company's response team to focus on threats that truly need their expertise. Hexadite's Automated Incident Response Solution platform can integrate with customers' existing security technologies and can cut response time by 95 percent, the company says.Co-founder and CEO Eran Barak spent five years in an elite intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces before starting Hexadite in 2014 and was also head of Elbit Systems' cybertraining and simulation team. Late last year the company formed an alliance with other cybersecurity companies across the country, including Carbon Black, Check Point Software Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to better integrate their products and automate important security processes.The goal of the alliance, explains Barak, is to utilize software to lighten the workload of security teams so that they can focus their time on the most dangerous and complex threats.

Taking full control of the brokerage is a centrepiece of Mr Gorman’s strategy. Morgan Stanley declined to comment.People familiar with the bank’s thinking have said Morgan Stanley could consider buying all of Smith Barney outright, but its ultimate decision will depend on price. Analysts have valued Citi’s remaining Smith Barney stake at around $10 billion.Morgan Stanley would most likely have to issue debt to fund the purchase, people say. That would become more expensive if Morgan Stanley is downgraded. Moody’s put Morgan Stanley, along with five other banks, on review for a downgrade in February. The bank could see its rating reduced by as many as three notches to Baa2 - two levels above junk status.A downgrade would also force Morgan Stanley to provide additional collateral to back its vast derivatives business, where it acts as a counterparty. Mr Gorman has been meeting Moody’s executives since earlier this year. The chief executive, who took over from John Mack at the beginning of 2010, is also thought to be discussing possible steps the bank could take to cushion the impact of a downgrade. These include shifting the banks’ derivatives books to a higher-rated subsidiary, which would help save it collateral costs. Other banks including Citigroup and Bank of America have done this.Other major banks, such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , are also on review for downgrade at Moody’s. Morgan Stanley agreed to fold its retail brokerage business into a joint venture with Smith Barney in 2009. The venture is a key component of the bank’s push to become less dependent on volatile trading operations.“[A downgrade] will make it more expensive [to issue debt] on the margin, but the overall cost of funding is not very expensive,” said one banker, who specializes in selling financials’ debt. Markets may be pricing in a higher cost of funding, he added.",11:25.1
10,Consultant to 'Vampire Squid of Expert Network Firms' Questioned by FBI,2010-11-30T15:42:50+0000,Ash Bennington,"We know that one of the principal focuses of the government in their investigation into insider trading in general—and into hedge funds in particular—are the so-called ""expert-network"" firms.","cnbc, Articles, CNBC EVENTS, NetNet, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","We know that one of the principal focuses of the government in their investigation into insider trading in general—and into hedge funds in particular—are the so-called ""expert-network"" firms.The purpose of the expert network firms is to provide information and insight about companies that investors are interested in—and also, perhaps more crucially, to help manage the relationships between the investors and the managers of companies they seek to invest in. Think about the nature of that scenario: Investors and managers chatting together informally, outside the scope of more traditional venues like earnings calls and IR events. It seems a safe bet that, amid allegations of widespread insider trading, the government might be interested in exploring that channel to see if material nonpublic information might have changed hands. Today, the news is that Gerson Lehrman Group, the largest of the expert network firms, had at least one of its consultants questioned by the FBI. For those not familiar with the hedge fund/expert network axis, the significance of this may not be immediately obvious. While Gerson Lehrman Group may sound to the uninitiated a bit like a dish prepared by the Swedish Chef on the Muppets, this firm is a very serious player in the expert network space. The Wall Street Journal reports that ""Gerson controls two-thirds of the market for expert networks"" To put that number in perspective, think about this: JPMorgan is the current leader in capital markets transaction—and they control only 7.8 percent market share. So, in the space they play in, Gerson is a vampire squid on steroids. The Wall Street Journal article alludes to the significance: ""The FBI questioning of the Gerson consultant shows the government's examination of the expert-network business is broader than Primary Global. Criminal and civil authorities are investigating whether these consultants passed inside information to clients, who pay the expert companies large fees for their services."" It seems that it's not just Gerson in the crosshairs—but more broadly the clients they serviced. And which firms are Gerson clients? According to the Journal: ""In recent years, Gerson's client roster has included prominent hedge funds like SAC Capital Advisors LLC, mutual-fund company Fidelity Investments, private-equity firm Carlyle Group LLC and Wall Street investment banks, said people familiar with the matter."" The phrase ""has included"" tells you that we're not looking at an exhaustive inventory in the list that follows—but only a sampling. And the message from that sample seems to be that Gerson clients are many of the big boys. Interestingly, no ""Wall Street investment banks"" are cited by name – but if the sampling of hedge funds and private equity groups provided is representative of the caliber of firms Gerson did business with on the banking side, you might expect to see some of your favorite A-list players from the top of the banking league tables represented on their client list. The Journal article reports that Diamondback Capital —which has already been raided by the FBI in the probe—is a client of Gerson. It is important to note that no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against Gerson or any of its employees related to the current probe.

Southwest also said it does not have an agreement with the NRA.The NRA called the decision of the companies to cut perks to the NRA ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve,"" the NRA added.United and Delta had offered airfare discounts of between 2 percent and 10 percent, according to the NRA's website.

One of them, in fact, has lost almost half its value so far in 2010, but Cramer said it could end up being one of the best stocks to own over the next six months. The others, whose loses may not be as severe, still stand up as very attractive buys for the rest of the year, Cramer said. Investors who agree with him probably want to buy in now, as these picks won’t stay secret for long.Read on for the Top 6 Comeback Stocks of 2010.Posted 26 July 2010When Cramer highlighted Verizon on July 12, the stock had fallen 15% over the first six months of 2010. They may come as little surprise given that telecommunications was the S&P 500’s worst-of-the-worst sector over the same time period, but Cramer is expecting a turnaround here, at least for Verizon.He said the company holds “huge opportunities” in the wireless space, where it owns 55% of the second-largest carrier in the industry, Verizon Wireless. And with the “reaffirmed rumors” that the company will start selling the Apple iPhone in January 2011, “I think … Verizon should lead the industry in terms of market share gains,” given how much of a game-changer the handset was for AT&T. And that’s not even taking into account smartphones as a whole. Only 17% of the company’s wireless subscribers own true smartphones, leaving open a huge opportunity for revenue growth as they make the switch.Click here for more on Verizon.Cramer thinks this graphics chipmaker, down 40% in the first half of the year, should snap back thanks to a number of new revenue-driving products for gaming PCs, notebooks, netbooks tablets and smartphones. There’s also new visual computing software, like Adobe’s Creative Suite 5, require NVIDIA’s high-end semiconductors, also giving a boost to revenues.The company’s ION chips for notebook computers are in 70 laptop designs, 50 of which are scheduled to start production in the next six months. And NVIDIA’s chip for smartphones and tablets should be in a whole slew of products that are also going into production during the last part of the year.For these reasons, NVDA should be ramping ahead of these products launches, not losing nearly half its share-price value. And that’s why Cramer thinks the stock could be “one of the biggest gainers in the second half” of 2010.Click here for more on NVIDIA.Oddly, Jabil’s stock took a 15% hit over the first two quarters of the year, even though the company’s June 22 earnings report showed a business that is firing on all cylinders. The problem? Too much exposure to Europe – as much as 31% of Jabil’s production ends up on the Continent – and that has sent investors running. According to the company, though, there has been no slowdown in business there. So that collective freak-out was all for naught. And as Europe comes back, Cramer said, so should JBL. Investors might consider buying the stock now given how cheap it is.Click here for more on Jabil Circuit.The catalyst for this stock’s rebound will most likely be study that Range Resource conducted on its drilling practices that flew in the face of environmentalists everywhere. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process by which natural-gas drillers like RRC use large amounts of water with some chemical additives to boost production, and there had been concerns from both environmentalists and the Environmental Protection Agency that it could contaminate drinking water – even though there never been any documented cases of that contamination.Well, Range Resources in July disclosed that , for its Marcellus shale wells, 99.86% of its drilling fluid consists of water and sand, with just 0.14% comprising highly diluted chemicals. RRC was the first company to “open its books,” so to speak, in this way, and RRC rallied accordingly.“I think maybe this the beginning of a major turn in the stock,” Cramer said.Click here for more on Range Resources.This health-care company lost 11.4% of its value this year, in part, because of its exposure to Europe – 24% of the company's sales come from the Continent. But Cramer thinks this will become less of an issue in the second half of the year, as CEO Miles White has vowed to take a conservative stance on European business.Cramer also likes the pharmaceutical company's range of drugs and little exposure to generics. Its flagship product, Humira, is a psoriasis drug and anti-inflammatory, which makes up 35% of the company's sales and is growing by 20%.The Abbott Park, Ill.-based company is also making ""savvy"" acquisitions in emerging markets, including India, which is an $8 billion pharmaceutical market that's expected to double in size by 2015. Plus, the company boasts a 3.6% dividend yield and, for the last 38 years, has increased its payout every year. 2010 should be no different, Cramer said, because it's growing earnings at 11% annually, which is twice the pace of other pharmaceuticals.Click here for more on Abbott Labs.This West Chester, Ohio-based steel company struggled in the first half of the year, posting a 37% decline year-to-date. Cramer didn't like this stock at first because it's not a vertically-integrated steel maker, meaning it doesn't have its own mines and needs to buy its primary raw materials. In other words, AK Steel's operating costs were very high.But Cramer thinks this stock could be poised for a turnaround, as those costs have since plummeted. He also likes the company's management, who reduced the employee headcount by 30% while maintaining the same production capacity. At the same time, the company has used more than $2 billion of internally generated cash to shore up its balance sheet. It has also managed to muddle through the recession without selling equity, issuing debt or cutting its small dividend, which has a 1.4% yield.Click here for more on AK Steel.",11:27.3
27,What Apple’s $100 Billion Really Means ,2012-01-25T20:27:04+0000,John Carney,"Apple’s jaw-dropping announcement that it had nearly $100 billion in cash on hand at the end of the last quarter has many people scrambling for ideas about what Apple should do with all that loot.Apple said this week it ended the last quarter and the year with $97.6 billion in cash, to be exact — much of it held overseas for tax purposes. By comparison, that's twice as much cash as Google, which ended the year with $44.6 billion in the bank.","cnbc, Articles, Microsoft Corp, Apple Inc, Alphabet Class A, CNBC EVENTS, NetNet, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Apple’s jaw-dropping announcement that it had nearly $100 billion in cash on hand at the end of the last quarter has many people scrambling for ideas about what Apple should do with all that loot.Apple said this week it ended the last quarter and the year with $97.6 billion in cash, to be exact — much of it held overseas for tax purposes. By comparison, that's twice as much cash as Google, which ended the year with $44.6 billion in the bank. Apple officials said the company is discussing ways to use the cash.  There’s some speculation that they could use it to build out the supply chain, lending money to their suppliers to bolster productivity, or perhaps increase their investment in Apple TV. Many investors, of course, would like the see the company pay a dividend. But the low multiple to earnings suggests that the market doesn’t see this in the offing. The main problem with a company that has accumulated a huge amount of cash is the temptation to do something foolish with it. Acquisitions, for instance, tend to increase when companies find themselves with an abundance of cash.  This seems unlikely in the case of Apple, since there appears to be few acquisition opportunities that wouldn’t raise antitrust concerns. What most people do not appreciate about cash is that it is a strategic asset. Cash holdings might appear to do nothing in good times, but when credit constricts or markets wobble — and usually these things happen together — he who lives with the most cash wins. It's tempting to think of Apple's cash hoard as a shield it can hide behind in tough times. But that's not quite right. It's more like a sword — a weapon to strike against weaker rivals. Companies with large cash holdings are reliably able to capture market share from cash-constrained competitors. Where the cash-poor competitors are forced to cut costs, reduce marketing and slow expansion if consumer demand slows, the cash rich can pour even more resources into hiring, marketing and development. They can use a crisis as an opportunity. This is competition at its bloodiest. You can see why so many of the other top tech companies — such as Google  and Microsoft — are also accumulating cash. They are all attempting to assure that if global markets take a downturn, they can keep flying high. Questions? Comments?

At the time, the failure was blamed on higher fuel prices; indeed, oil prices hit a 10-month high as we closed out that month.That was the first non-confirmation that got bears going. Then, as we moved into a new quarter in April, it was noted that the small-cap Russell 2000 began underperforming the S&P 500. It is a modest underperformance (down 4.7 percent for the month vs. the down 2.9 percent S&P underperformance) but it too has been seized upon by bears as a sign that U.S. growth — even with modest expectations of 2.5 percent GDP growth — may be moderating. Now, the Nasdaq — which has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 all year (up 14.5 percent vs. 8.7 percent), is underperforming — but only for today. Volume on the Nasdaq is slightly higher than normal. It's not just Apple , plenty of other companies like Seagate, Broadcomm and even Netflix have turned in stellar performances this year. I know everyone is worried about AAPL down 5 days in a row, but this is the first day the Nasdaq has significantly underperformed. It's a sign of the power of AAPL that even a one-day drop has traders wondering. This is tricky. Apple, by traditional valuation metrics, is not overpriced.

33,Bryce Harper's $330 million Phillies contract can't solve baseball's bigger spending problem,2019-03-03T17:00:13+0000,Donovan Russo,"Major League Baseball spring training is underway and some of the biggest concerns about spending by teams headed into the MLB season have now been addressed, with roughly $1 billion spent on new player contracts within the last two weeks.

The week previous, the San Diego Padres doled out $300 million over 10 years to Manny Machado. The Colorado Rockies also resigned Nolan Arenado to an eight-year, $260 million contract; the New York Yankees gave outfielder Aaron Hicks a seven-year, $70 million deal; and the St. Louis Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas received four years and $68 million.But bigger problems persist for the MLB: Attendance is down, games are still too long, and the gap between the richest and poorest teams remains wide, leading to a lack of competitiveness from many teams .Eight major league teams experienced double-digit attendance losses in 2018, led by the Miami Marlins' 52 percent decline — the laggard was no surprise, as the Marlins traded both 2017 National League Most Valuable Player Giancarlo Stanton to the New York Yankees and Christian Yelich to the Milwaukee Brewers (who went on to win the 2018 National League MVP award) before the season began, as part of the beginning of a long rebuilding process.Several currently successful teams embraced a rebuilding process, such as the 2017 World Series champion Houston Astros and 2016 World Series champion Chicago Cubs.

The Baltimore Orioles went 47-115 last season; the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds have both had five or more straight losing seasons since 2014.Stephen J.K. Walters, a professor of economics at Loyola University Maryland and former economic advisor to MLB teams, said mid- and small-market teams are taking an approach that is defensible. ""The current amount of competitive imbalance — for example, Baseball Prospectus forecasts that only 5 of 15 American League teams will have winning records, with 82 wins or more — is chiefly a result of mid- and small-market teams' acceptance of the idea that they can get away with boring their fans for a few years as also-rans while they hoard high draft picks and prospects, and then they'll be good and all will be forgiven.""According to Roto Champ, the Padres now have the second-best prospect in baseball with Fernando Tatis Jr., a 20-year-old shortstop from the Dominican Republic and son of a former major leaguer. The Padres, White Sox, Reds and Rays possess a combined seven of the top 20 players on Roto Champ's list.Under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), revenue sharing dollars have to be utilized in effort to try and improve winning but that does not necessarily mean those dollars have to be invested in free agency. The MLB commissioner may require a team to submit a report that details its efforts to win over the next two years if he feels that team has violated any of the rules that come along with the revenue sharing procedure.Last year, the MLB Players Association filed grievances against the Tampa Bay Rays, Miami Marlins, Pittsburgh Pirates and Oakland Athletics, claiming each team did not spend its revenue sharing money in the expected manner.In the Moneyball era, spending smart on talent doesn't have to mean spending the most and there are examples of tighter-wad teams performing on the field at a high level. The Athletics made the playoffs last season, losing to the Yankees in the American League wild card round. The Rays won 90 games, but fell short of clinching a playoff spot. Each of these team's 2018 payrolls was below $90 million and this year seems to be heading in the same direction. These four teams rank towards the bottom (25-30) of team payroll trackings, with the Rays at a league low just above $51 million.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred addressed the grievances during a recent spring training appearance with the Pittsburgh Pirates president Frank Coonelly. ""Tony Clark (MLBPA Director of Player Relations) started the assertion that teams aren't trying to win by singling out four teams,"" Manfred said, according to a report in the Pittsburgh Gazette. ""He did a very poor job with those teams. One won 97 games, another won 90, and the other was a game above .500, right Frank (Coonelly)? Two games above .500. Our teams are trying. They all want to win."" Manfred added, ""This narrative that our teams aren't trying is just not supported by the facts. Our teams are trying. Every single one of them wants to win. It may look a little different to outsiders because the game has changed. The way people think about putting a winning team together has changed. But that doesn't mean they're not trying.""Walters said part of the competitive balance problem is the revenue sharing model used by the MLB.""The fix: a requirement that the bulk of revenue-sharing receipts gets spent on major-league talent,"" he said. ""In any case, competitive balance is more about 'compression' of spending on payroll. … To encourage those low-spending, small-market teams to buy a little more talent, I'd tweak MLB's revenue-sharing formula. It's complicated, but right now money gets distributed based on market size, but if it was a combination of market size and wins, that would breathe more life into the free agent market.""In effect, it would incentivize smaller market teams to spend more on players and create a positive feedback loop in which spending more would result in receiving more from revenue sharing.""Optimal revenue sharing is an empirical question because it ultimately depends on the supply-side objectives of club owners throughout the league. Owners range from being profit maximizers who are only in it for the money to sportsmen gamers who are only in it to win it,"" said John Vrooman, an economics professor at Vanderbilt University.But not all economists agree that revenue sharing is broken, or even, the root of the problem. David Berri, professor of economics at Southern Utah University and the author of ""Sports Economics"" views a limited population of talent rather than revenue sharing as the primary reason for the competitive imbalance.""Baseball was not competitive in the first half of the 20th century because the talent pool was restricted (only white males from the U.S. played). Racial integration and a global search for talent expanded the talent pool and made the game much more competitive,"" Berri said.None of this is to say the business of baseball is not a financial success. In fact, the MLB is flush with cash. The league grossed $10.3 billion in 2018, the 16th-consecutive year that the league saw record gross revenue, according to a widely cited annual Forbes report based on information provided from league sources to baseball writer Maury Brown. And despite a 4.1 percent attendance drop in 2018, television broadcasts for twelve major league teams ranked first in their market in primetime, according to Major League Baseball.The MLB saw a five-year viewership high on its Fox package, which in part contributed to a seven-year extension with Fox Sports, continuing to air World Series and All Star games through 2028, an extension worth a reported $5.1 billion.The MLB also was ahead of professional sports league peers in its development of streaming technology, a forward-thinking effort that ultimately resulted in Disney's billion-dollar-plus purchase of BAMTech, the MLB's internet start-up, now valued at close to $4 billion.Although the MLB has crowned eight different World Series winners in the last 10 years, it has for the most part been a similar set of teams making the playoffs each year. The Los Angeles Dodgers (who lost in the last two World Series) have consistently won the National League West since 2013. The Boston Red Sox (the current World Series champion), have won four titles since 2004. And the New York Yankees, another money spending powerhouse, have only missed the playoffs four times since 2008. These teams are consistently atop league leaders in payrolls.Despite competing for a good majority of last season, the Phillies faded down the stretch, finishing the season with an 80-82 record. Phillies owner John Middleton said in November that his organization was going into the offseason ready to spend ""and maybe even be a little bit stupid about it.""As Red Sox owner John Henry put it: ""It's very difficult to predict things in baseball, to predict player performance. Spending more money helps.""",11:28.2

35,"Chinese Retail Sales Surge, Partly on Inflation",2007-09-12T04:25:04+0000,,"China's retail sales growth surged in August to its quickest pace in more than three years, beating forecasts, but analysts said the jump largely reflected stronger inflation, not necessarily quicker underlying growth. Retail sales, which are tracked in nominal terms, grew 17.1% from a year earlier, compared with 16.4% in July. The uptick roughly tracked a rise in annual consumer inflation in August to 6.5%, from 5.6% in July. ""Retail sales growth is obviously strong. The problem is that the figures are being pushed up by the rising inflation as well. So actually, on a real basis, I don't think there's much of an acceleration,"" said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. August's pace, the quickest since May 2004, beat economists' expectations of a 16.5% rise. Consumer inflation data, released on Tuesday, also surprised on the upside. Beijing would welcome an increase in real buying activity by the country's consumers. It is trying to tilt its economy away from what economists call an unsustainable reliance on exports -- to the tune of 40% of national output. Not only does China's gaping trade surplus -- it hit $25 billion in August -- contribute to tensions with its major trading partners, it also exposes it more to any downturn in the United States or other economies. Cavey said that a lynchpin of Beijing's efforts to spur spending would be their effectiveness in the countryside, and that a recent epidemic among pigs was likely to blunt growth in spending there this year. ""We will expect retail sales growth to continue to be strong next year as the countryside gets over all this,"" he said. In the details, the retail sales data suggested a significant impact from the recent spike in food price inflation. Sales of grain and edible oils and meat, eggs and poultry, two of the categories where price rises have been most striking, rose 44% and 45.2%, respectively. Still, Lin Songli, senior economist at Guosen Securities in Beijing, said the figures showed that consumption was starting to take up a greater role in driving the world's fastest-growing major economy.

39,Porn and the Condom Conundrum ,2012-01-18T22:09:31+0000,,Los Angeles may be about to lose its title as the US porn capital.,"cnbc, Articles, Business News, Life, Entertainment, Adult Entertainment, Adult Entertainment Expo, Porn Convention 2012, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Los Angeles may be about to lose its title as the US porn capital. The L.A. City Council voted Tuesday to make condom use mandatory in adult films. And adult studios are already planning how to minimize the effects of that law.Technically, the legislation, which will tie mandatory condom use on set to city film permit approvals for porn shoots, needs to first be approved by the city's mayor — and won't go into effect until police officials, the city attorney and others figure out how it might be enforced. That gives adult entertainment companies time to adapt. And some of the biggest studios say the first option is to relocate production to other areas. ""[Studios] will move out of the city of L.A. and they'll stop shooting here,"" says Steven Hirsch, founder and co-chairman of Vivid Entertainment, the industry's largest studio. ""There's no question of that. … I'm not sure what they're going to accomplish aside from kicking the industry outside of the city "" Hirsch estimates porn studios have shot over 300,000 scenes in the past six years, with the majority of those being filmed in the L.A. area. (The San Fernando Valley is nicknamed ""Porn Valley"" because of the industry's tight concentration there.) A filming permit in L.A. carries a basic application fee of $625 and usually comes with additional costs, depending on location and the activities filmed. That makes the porn industry a notable source of revenue for the city. Scott Taylor, founder of New Sensations, says his company will comply with the law for L.A. shoots, but he, too, expects to move filming outside the city. ""L.A. County does have borders and if we need to adapt, we will,"" he says. ""It's a real pain to do so, but we will have to find off-the-beaten-path locations."" One location that could become a new favorite is Las Vegas. The town that bills itself ""Sin City"" is already a second home to the porn industry, playing host to its annual convention each year. Additionally, there are tax savings to be had by shooting there that could cover some of the expenses of moving production to the area. Ultimately, say studio executives, the decision on where to focus shooting if they do move productions outside of L.A. will depend on where the performers settle. The decision to make condom use mandatory for adult actors is a notable winfor the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has been lobbying for it for some time. The Free Speech Coalition, the porn industry's trade association, criticized the vote. A legal challenge is possible, though isn't certain, say insiders. And the porn exodus might not stop at filming locations. Hirsch says Vivid hasn't made any final decisions but is not opposed to relocating to another city if performers begin to settle in a new territory. That's a move of last resort, of course. Moving a company to another state carries a lot of expense — and for a studio as diversified as Vivid or New Sensations, it's not always practical.Taylor, for instance, says he has no plans to leave L.A. ""I have a multitude of businesses,"" he says. ""I have a distribution facility that puts the products in stores and an Internet division that handles a lot of digital sites, so uprooting that core and moving it really isn't realistic."" Smaller studios, though, might be more willing to uproot. Or, alternatively, they might simply ignore the regulations or film without permits — as many currently do. ""There will be many smaller companies that will go ahead and shoot anyway,"" notes Hirsch. ""Some people will shoot their movies regardless."" Some porn studios, meanwhile, won't be affected at all by the law. Girlfriend Films, which specializes in lesbian movies, won't have to change its practices. And Wicked Pictures has maintained a condoms-only policy since 2004, putting it in compliance with the new legislation.",11:29.0

43,Citigroup to Halve Investment Spending in 2007,2006-12-14T23:29:44+0000,,"Citigroup, the top U.S. bank by assets, expects its investment spending next year to be less than half the 2006 level, its chief executive said on Thursday, acknowledging that its consumer bank has yet to turn the corner. Speaking at the bank's analyst day presentation, Charles ""Chuck"" Prince also said he shares investors' frustration with the bank's lackluster share performance, but encouraged shareholders to be patient. ""I feel very good about the changes were making ... but there's no short-cut to get from where we are to where we're going,"" he said. Prince, under increasing pressure from investors, on Monday named a new chief operating officer at the bank and promised an increased focus on costs. During Thursday's presentation, Prince discussed ways Citigroup aims to increase revenue, including expanding its financial advisory business and increasing its private banking efforts. Increased revenue and lower investment spending should help Citigroup's revenue grow faster than expenses next year, and profits grow faster than revenue, Prince said. That ""positive operating leverage"" would reverse a trend this year of operating expense growth outpacing revenue growth. Citigroup's relatively weak earnings growth has weighed on its shares, which are up 8.7% so far this year, lagging an 11.6% gain in the KBW Bank index for the same period. Investors gave a moderate vote of confidence to Prince's latest prescriptions for the bank's ills, boosting Citigroup shares by 0.8% and making them one of the session's top gainers in the sector index. ""That (cut in 2007 investment spending) is giving investors confidence thatthere may be operating leverage in 2007 after not seeing a lot of operating leverage in the last couple of years,"" said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager at Baring Asset Management Inc. in Boston, which owns Citigroup shares. ""I think that's what investors are keying off on.""Overseas GrowthOthers remained skeptical. ""It's more of the same,"" said William Smith, chief executive of SAMAdvisors, LLC, which owns Citigroup stock. ""In our opinion, it's disturbing that he (Prince) does not understand what's going on. He is losing the battle here as far as what shareholders want."" Smith said Citigroup shares had been bolstered last week by talk that the bank could replace Chief Financial Officer Sallie Krawcheck or even Prince, or could spin off some units. Prince said revenue growth in the U.S. consumer bank was taking longer than he had expected, but he was cautiously optimistic about it improving. The company is taking steps like combining its brokerage and bank franchises, in an effort to offer more products to customers. Prince said the company was unlikely to make any large U.S. bank acquisitions in 2007, reiterating that there were better opportunities to buy businesses overseas. Citigroup on Wednesday agreed to acquire Central American commercial and retail bank Grupo Cuscatlan for $1.51 billion and last month led a team of investors that won control of China's Guangdong Development Bank with a bid of 24.3 billion yuan ($3.1 billion). Citigroup is budgeting for moderate deterioration in credit quality for 2007, Prince said. Prince, who met with analysts alongside chief-operating-officer-to-be Robert Druskin, Krawcheck and other executives, also said Citigroup could boost credit loss reserves in Japan due to legislative changes.","cnbc, Articles, Business News, Economy, US Economy, US: News, source:tagname:Reuters","Citigroup, the top U.S. bank by assets, expects its investment spending next year to be less than half the 2006 level, its chief executive said on Thursday, acknowledging that its consumer bank has yet to turn the corner.

44,Euro zone to launch bailout fund with Spain in focus,2012-10-08T09:04:00+0000,,"By Jan Strupczewski   BRUSSELS, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers willlaunch their 500 billion euro ($653.00 billion) permanentbailout fund on Monday, putting in place a major defence againstthe debt crisis that now threatens Spain.   The fund, called the European Stability Mechanism (ESM),will be used to lend to distressed euro zone sovereigns inreturn for strict fiscal and structural reforms that aim to puteconomies that have lost investor trust back on track.   It is part of the single currency area's drive for anoverhaul of its economic structures and deeper integration, adiscussion that will be taken forward on Monday with talks on anidea to create a single euro-zone budget.   Euro zone finance ministers, who form the ESM's board ofgovernors, will hold their inaugural meeting in Luxembourg twoyears after EU leaders endorsed the idea of setting up such apermanent institution.   ""The ESM will be operational as of Monday,"" said a euro zoneofficial, linked to the ESM.   The fund's lending capacity will be based on 80 billioneuros of paid-in capital and 620 billion of callable capital,against which the ESM will borrow money on the market to lend iton to governments cut off from sustainable market funding.   It will reach its full capacity gradually by 2014.   Its first task will be to lend to Spain for therecapitalisation of its banking sector, hit hard by a collapseof the real estate market - a programme inherited from thetemporary European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).   Madrid is likely to ask for about 40 billion euros torecapitalise its banks following independent assessments of thesectors' needs -- well within the 100 billion euros set aside byeuro zone finance ministers for the purpose in July.   The ESM money would flow to Spain in November, afterEuropean Commission competition authorities approve conditionsfor the recapitalisation for each bank.   SPAIN IN FOCUS   Spain is in investors' focus because it has struggled to cutone of the euro zone's largest public deficits as the countrysinks deeper into its second recession in three years.   In Luxembourg, euro zone ministers will also discuss arequest, expected from Spain sometime in the coming weeks, for aprecautionary credit line from the ESM that they hope will boostinvestor confidence and keep Madrid in the capital markets.   A euro zone source said they may also discuss Spain's tough2013 budget, outlined last month, which the InternationalMonetary Fund and the European Commission both believe is basedon an over-optimistic forecast of a 0.5 percent economiccontraction next year. The current IMF forecast of a 1.2 percentrecession may be revised further downwards on Tuesday.   A revised budget based on updated IMF and EU forecasts maybe one condition for assistance from the ESM.   Such a programme would likely entail the issuance offirst-loss guarantees on bonds sold by Spain at auction, or somesimilar form of rescue to bolster Madrid's credibility.   Guaranteeing the first 20-30 percent loss on new Spanishbonds would allow - through leveraging - all of Spain's 207billion debt issuance in 2013 to be made much more attractive toinvestors using roughly 50 billion euros of euro zone money.   Such an amount would fit comfortably within the 100 billionlimit already approved by parliaments for the bank rescue incountries with strong anti-bailout sentiment like Germany andFinland, making it politically more palatable, even iftechnically it would remain a separate operation.   A credit line for Spain would also open the way forpurchases of Spanish bonds on the secondary market by theEuropean Central Bank -- a prospect that has lowered Spanishyields already from above 7 percent in July to below 5.72 now.   But Germany opposes a Spanish bailout request now, becauseit would prefer to bundle Spain with a request for a small, 15billion euro bailout for Cyprus and a revision of the second,130 billion euro bailout for Greece in one crisis-solvingpackage later this year.   This would allow German Chancellor Angela Merkel, wary ofshaky support for bailouts in her own ruling coalition, to pushthe large crisis package through parliament in one go, ratherthan fight separate battles for each.   As a result, a Spanish request is unlikely for a few weeks.

45,Absolut Breakthrough: CBS Allows Spirits Ad During Grammys,2009-02-09T22:23:28+0000,Christina Cheddar Berk,"Those tuning into the Grammys may have caught a glimpse of a television milestone, and it didn’t happen on stage at the music awards show.Absolut vodka debuted a new ad, marking the first time a spirits brand aired a commercial during the Grammys. More importantly, it was also a first for spirits advertising in prime time in several CBS markets. The ad, which ran in 15 of the largest media markets on many CBS-owned-and-operated stations, is a breakthrough for the spirits industry, which has been rebuffed in its attempts to buy airtime on the major networks in the past. No doubt, the proliferation of advertisements on cable stations and local network affiliates has laid the groundwork for this event. “We’re not surprised, it’s been a steady progression,” said Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group. Coleman said the television advertising of spirits brands has built steadily over the past decade, although it has leveled off more recently as companies have spent more of their ad budget online. Absolut, a Swedish vodka brand that was purchased by Pernod Ricard last year, has long been known for its memorable advertising. “I think we continue to take an innovative approach to media and advertising,” said Ian Crystal, brand director of Absolut Vodka at Pernod Ricard USA. According to Crystal, there wasn’t any resistance at CBS and its affiliates. He attributes this to the “iconic” nature of the Absolut brand. For the first 25 years, the brand’s image was built around print advertising that centered on the distinctive shape of its bottle. But the campaign shifted in May 2007, with the launch of the “In An Absolut World” campaign. Now about 30 percent to 40 percent of the brand’s ad budget is spent on television and film advertising. According to Crystal, the campaign’s concept is about ideas, which translate well on film, and therefore lends itself to television advertising. The latest incarnation of the campaign is the “Hugs” spot, which depicts scenes from an idealized world. As the music of Louis Armstrong plays, people from around the world exchange hugs and other signs of affection rather than currency. The 30-second spot, created by ad agency TBWAChiatDay, will continue to air on broadcast and cable in seven key markets over the next week. Events like the Grammys are often used by advertisers as a way of reaching a mass audience joined by a common interest. Music is a leading interest among adults 21 years to 24 years old, who are Absolut’s key demographic. Last year, the Grammy Awards reached an estimated 17 million viewers.

What led to  this change? Politics.  On Wednesday, Sen. Mary Landrieu, the embattled  Democrat, facing a Dec. 6 runoff, called on the Senate to  put the Keystone pipeline issue up for a vote. She was pushing  for this to be the first order of business in the lame-duck  session of Congress.  In quick turn, the Democratic leadership blessed the gambit, in  what political reporters on Capitol Hill are calling the ""Hail  Mary"" to save Landrieu's Senate seat. The idea is to get her name  on the bill that approves the pipeline, which is very popular in  her home state of Louisiana, where she is behind in in the polls. Late Wednesday the Republican leadership announced they had a  deal with Democrats for a vote as early as Tuesday. How did the  decisions to vote next week happen? Politics.    When House leadership got wind of the Hail Mary, they quickly  crafted a Keystone pipeline bill to hit the House floor this  week. The author of the bill is listed as Rep. Bill Cassidy, the  Republican congressman from Louisiana and the candidate facing  Landrieu in the Dec. 6 runoff election for the Senate  seat.

In addition to the timing  issues, the bill will need 60 votes to overcome procedural  hurdles. Until now the best Keystone had done was 54 votes.

It's been going  on for six years,"" said Dan Clifton, head of policy research at  Strategas.  The approval of the Keystone XL pipeline extension was held  up by the Obama administration initially for environmental impact  studies. The pipeline's approval came under the auspices of the  State Department because TransCanada's pipeline would cross over  the border into the U.S. after passing through Alberta and  Saskatchewan in Canada. It would then travel through Montana,  South Dakota and Nebraska and link up with another pipeline,  carrying crude from Canada, North Dakota, Montana and Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast.

The Saudi comments are a  reminder to the market that the Saudis aren't powerless, but OPEC  is overall for sure. At some point, the sell-off will be  vulnerable to a production response.

But they did  come a day after Venezuela's oil minister said OPEC cannot allow  a price war and must act to stabilize prices. He said oil could  go as low as the ""mid-$20s.""Read MoreHere's the comments that sent oil higherThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries just a year  ago moved to a policy of allowing the market to set prices for  the first time, instead of trying to stabilize them with a  production response. Saudi Arabia, then the world's swing  producer, said it would not cut production unless others  producers joined in, particularly the high-cost producers. That  would include U.S. shale drillers.  OPEC meets again on Dec. 4. ""They're not going to do anything.  They're going to sit pat,"" said Edward Morse, head of global  commodities research at Citigroup.  Morse said he expects OPEC members like Venezuela will be  pleading with the Saudis to cut production. ""I don't think Saudi  Arabia or any of the Gulf Cooperation Council yet are in a  position to say our strategy doesn't work,"" he said. ""I've  written that OPEC is dead frequently enough that I have to  believe it,"" said Morse. ""It's unlikely they're going to get a  joint decision anytime soon involving a production cut that  includes Iraq, Iran and Venezuela, let alone Libya.""  Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said Monday he doubted OPEC  has the will to act as a group to support oil prices. When asked  about the Saudi comments, the minister said, ""I don't believe  there is strong intention from some parts of OPEC to stabilize  the market."" He said the cartel's mission is to stabilize the market  for the benefit of all its members. ""If (that) is subject to  cooperation with non-OPEC producers then it means we are going to  do nothing.""   Iran is a particular challenge for OPEC since it has vowed to  return to production as soon as it can under an international  agreement to end its nuclear program. Some analysts expect  tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which has benefited from  Iran's loss of share in the global oil market.  ""Iranians want to raise production. The Saudis don't want to  accommodate them. The Saudis aren't going to do that. It's really  a nonstarter,"" said Greg Priddy, director of global energy and  natural resources at the Eurasia Group.  ""I don't think there's a commonality of interest,"" said Priddy of  OPEC's members. Priddy, however, said he expects the cartel to stay in  existence despite the differences because the members could lose  face if they disbanded.   OPEC's price strategy backfired in some ways because other  producers, like Russia and U.S. shale, were willing to keep  pumping and now oil is stuck at a low price for longer.  ""I think the members that matter, the Saudis and their close  partners, are simply maintaining output and letting the  rebalancing play out. It hasn't played out as they intended but  they're locked into it now,"" Priddy said.  He said the inventories could continue to build into late next  year, and it could be into 2017 before there is a drawdown.  As for Monday's oil price move, analysts said OPEC was firing off  rhetoric ahead of its meeting. WTI closed at $41.75, down 15  cents, but it had been more than $1 higher.  ""They know there's a lot of short interest in the market right  now. You can trigger a mini short squeeze that plays out over a  couple of hours.

Straddling Europe, Asia and the Middle East, it’s a Muslim country with ancient Christian roots — but founded as a modern nation in 1923 by a militant secularist, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. For decades an economic backwater, it’s now the fastest-growing economy in Europe.That economic success was achieved by an Islamist-leaning government that has managed successfully to meld the conservative religious devotion of the masses with the economic interests of the secular elite.But what if Turkey, propelled by its majority of populist conservative Muslims, were to adopt a more extreme version of Islam? Syria, its neighbor to the south, is disintegrating — abetted according to some reports by rebels connected to Al Qaeda. Some of those rebels may be drifting across the border into Turkey. And there are rumors that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has intestinal cancer; with no clear successor to his decade-old leadership, his ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party could splinter and give rise to a more extremist Islamic rule. (Read More: Slideshow: Investing in Turkish Art)Yet experts say Turkey is so much improved economically from a decade ago that there is little chance its people would risk that prosperity — and relations with the West — to adopt an extremist Islamic state.That is not to say, however, that Turkey isn’t dealing with a precarious religious situation. “The society is going more conservative,” said Ebru Erdem, political science professor at the University of California at Riverside. “It’s been going on since the 1990s, and that is still in progress.” Erdem said Turks who don’t fast during the holy month of Ramadan, for instance, or who drink alcohol, face ostracism. And last spring the AKP ignited a debate about the morality of abortion and C-sections, two issues Erdem said had never before caused so much as a flicker on the Turkish radar screen. “They are not like the Islamist parties of before,” Erdem said. “They come from the same traditions, but they said they have taken off that shirt and they present themselves as a ‘liberal’ political party.” Erdem and other Turkey experts liken the religious dynamic in Turkey to none other than the U.S., comparing the AKP to the most conservative Christians of the Republican Party. “They are modeling on the Americans,” Erdem said. For instance, she said, the government has gradually begun regulating alcohol sales. “They say it’s not good for you, and they give the example of the U.S. Bible Belt, where you can’t buy alcohol on Sundays.” Brian Mello, a Turkey expert who teaches political science at Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania, said “political Islam is really popular, especially in Istanbul. You’ll see a lot of women wearing a headscarf, and if you look at the popular support for the ruling party, they’ve done nothing but increase their support.” He said “the real fear” is that Turkey is home to “various Islamic movements that have sought to reclaim the capacity to engage in religion in the public square. ... That could be a slippery slope to an Iranian-style Islamic regime.”  The emphasis is on the word “could,” however. According to Mello, “if you look at the U.S. now, and look at all the anti-abortion laws passed in state legislatures, and if you’re a secularist, then you might become afraid about the role of religion in American politics. If those fears are legitimate in the U.S., they’re legitimate in Turkey, too.” But Mello added: “The way religion affects the Republican Party in the United States is stronger than the way it affects (the ruling AKP) in Turkey.” Which is to say — interesting, worrying if you happen to be a secularist — but likely unimportant when it comes to the economy. (Read more:Investing in Europe’s Fastest-Growing Economy)Andrew Birch, senior economist for Europe for IHS, agrees. “When you look at the Justice and Development Party, there are a lot of concerns from the West, including the party’s lack of democracy. But from an economic point of view, they’ve been good stewards of the economy.” The biggest recent concern about Turkey’s Muslim bent was that its banks would adopt Islamic-style banking. (.) But that hasn’t happened — in fact, most of the country’s biggest banks operate exactly like Western ones. A more immediate concern is that Turkey’s economy has begun to slow, Birch said. Last year the economy grew at an 8.5 percent pace, but in the first half of 2012, its growth was below 3 percent. “If there are economic hardships, that’s going to give a boost to Islam because the fundamentalist movement is being drawn from poorer, disenfranchised areas,” Birch said. “But I’m not worried about them cycling back. As long as Istanbul stays important — that’s where the secular business people reside and hold a strong grasp — I wouldn’t be worried that much about an influx of conservative ideology going into the business sector.”  Erdem says the ruling party would probably like to enforce a more conservative Islamic society — but can’t afford to. “The current success is dependent on incoming foreign flows,” she said. “Especially with the financial crisis in Europe, a lot of hot money has come to Turkey because Turkey is stable. “Even if they wanted to [enforce a change] for an ideological reason, they couldn’t risk it,” Erdem said. “They owe their electoral success to economic security.”",11:31.2

His  past ventures included barber shop. He now works full-time  at the sneaker pawn shop.  The pair got the idea for the business when Chase was 14. Troy,  who is divorced, admits he indulged his son and allowed him to  amass a basketball sneaker collection worth about  $30,000. Troy then persuaded his son to sell the shoes to  generate the cash for a physical store. ""It was hard to let go of the collection because I was 14  years old with 200 pairs of sneakers, and all of the sudden you  have to go back to zero,"" Chase said. ""But it  was just part of becoming a young man and an entrepreneur."" In 2013, they sold Chase's shoes right out  of the trunk of Troy's car on 125th Street. But as word spread, they quickly realized they were onto  a big trend. Mom-and-pop pawn shops are ubiquitous, but few if  any are devoted to sneakers.

Janney forecasts sales will increase 12 percent to $4.7 billion  in 2015. Once considered a fringe urban shoe  trend, collecting basketball shoes reached a broader audience  when Nike  released its Air Jordan I in 1984. The shoe was launched by  Michael Jordan.  Troy said the markup on previously owned sneakers can be anywhere  from 100 percent to 800 percent given consumer demand. For  example, Nike's LeBron James ""Crown Jewel"" sneaker originally retailed for $250. But they're selling the pair  for more than $1,200 at Sneaker Pawn USA because of its limited  edition status.  ""This is the new stock market—these sneakers are  commodities,"" Troy said.   Troy and Chase won't disclose how much cash they're bringing in  per month, but say they hope to attract a private investor in  the next year to help them keep up with demand and expand into  locations across the country. In just six months of being  open, they say they're profitable.This year Chase is teaming up with a shoe manufacturing company,  Relevant Customs in Mount Vernon, New York, and plans to release a  high-end line of shoes. Styles will feature exotic leathers with  price tags of $10,000 and higher.  As for Chase's own private sneaker collection, it stands at  around 50 pairs today.

He  downplayed the possibility of an outbreak of disease from  unsanitary conditions, saying the ship had not seen an abnormal  number of people reporting to the infirmary as being ill.

The ship was about 200 miles south of Mobile, Ala., as Tuesday  faded into Wednesday, the Coast Guard said. Carnival says the  ship is expected to arrive in Mobile on Thursday.The ship left Galveston, Texas, for a four-day cruise last  Thursday with 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members. The ship  was about 150 miles off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Sunday when  an engine room fire knocked out its primary power source,  crippling its water and plumbing systems and leaving it adrift on  only a backup power.  No one was injured in the fire, but Carnival spokeswoman Joyce  Oliva said Tuesday that a passenger with a pre-existing medical  condition was taken off the ship as a precaution.  Everyone else likely will have to remain onboard until the ship  reaches Mobile, Ala., which is expected to happen Thursday,  weather permitting.  Besides two tugs, at least two other Carnival cruise ships have  been diverted to the Triumph to leave supplies and a 210-foot  Coast Guard cutter was at the scene, Coast Guard Petty Officer  Richard Brahm said Tuesday.  Mowlam said his son told him the lack of ventilation on the  Triumph had made it too hot to sleep inside and that many  passengers had set up camp on the ocean liner's decks and in its  common areas. Mowlam said he wasn't sure where his son was  sleeping.  ""He said up on deck it looks like a shanty town, with sheets,  almost like tents, mattresses, anything else they can pull to  sleep on,"" said Mowlam, of the southeast Texas town of Warren.  His son is from nearby Nederland.  Mowlam said his son indicated that passengers are trying to make  the best of a bad situation.  ""So far people have been pretty much taking it in stride,"" Mowlam  said his son told him.  Rob Mowlam told his father the ship's crew had started giving  free alcohol to passengers.  ""He was concerned about what that was going to lead to when  people start drinking too much,"" Mowlam said.  Other passengers have described more dire conditions, including  overflowing toilets and limited access to food.  Jay Herring, a former senior officer for Carnival Cruise Lines,  said one of the biggest concerns crew members will have until the  ship docks is the potential for disease outbreak, particularly  norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea.  ""Housekeeping, others are probably working double shifts to keep  the mess clean and wipe down and sanitize all the common areas,""  said Herring, who worked for Carnival from 2002 to 2004 and spent  four months on the Triumph.  Carnival hasn't determined what caused the fire, said Oliva, the  company spokeswoman.  The National Transportation Safety Board announced Tuesday it has  opened an investigation into the cause of the fire. The NTSB said  the Bahamas Maritime Agency will lead the investigation because  the ship carries a Bahamian flag.  The ship was originally going to be towed to a port in Progreso,  Mexico, but after currents pushed it northward, the company  decided to take it to Alabama, saying it would make it easier for  passengers without passports to get home.  Cahill said Carnival has reserved more than 1,500 hotel rooms in  Mobile and New Orleans for Thursday. The company plans to return  passengers back to Houston on Friday using charter flights.  A similar situation occurred on a Carnival cruise ship in  November 2010. That vessel, named Splendor, was stranded with  4,500 people aboard after a fire in the engine room. When the  passengers disembarked in San Diego, they described a nightmarish  three days in the Pacific with limited food, power and bathroom  access.  Cahill said the Spendor's fire was different because it involved  a ""catastrophic explosion"" in a diesel generator, and the  Triumph's fire had ""some other cause."" He could not say what the  economic impact will be due to the fire aboard the Triumph. The  impact from the Splendor was $40 million, he said.  Carnival canceled the Triumph's next two voyages, scheduled to  depart Monday and Saturday. Passengers aboard the stranded ship  will also receive a full refund.",11:31.7

Only when they’ve experienced running a business personally do they find that the reality is much different.Mike Cleary, for example, left his job as a sales and marketing executive to become an entrepreneur because he was tired of office politics. But after buying a franchise and an existing business about eight years ago, Cleary sparred with difficult vendors and suppliers. “It seemed very one-sided, with many commitments and obligations on my part, and much less required of the people I was buying from,” he said.In an effort to establish trust, he says, he extended credit to a client of the previous owner. Unfortunately, he says, the client was not forthcoming with payment, costing him tens of thousands of dollars in lost revenue.The Hiring HurdleFinding loyal employees was no picnic, either. “It was a harsh wake-up call,” said Cleary, adding, “to find out how many employees are not truly committed to the business they’re working for.”The recent recession was particularly hard on the revenue and cash flow of his small business. Eventually, he found himself too deeply in debt to continue, and he returned to working for an established organization.Today, he is content in his role as senior vice president for strategic marketing and field operations at the National Wild Turkey Federation in Edgefield, S.C., where he feels that he is living his personal mission to help conserve natural habitats. “I love that I’m finally in a position to worry about the high-level strategy instead of the other stuff, which just sapped my energy,” Cleary said. “It’s really freeing.”Many prospective entrepreneurs fail to realize that office politics are everywhere, and that you can’t escape them when you strike out on your own. You may still have to contend with rude clients and partners, with many situations feeling eerily similar to those of your days by the water cooler. And you often learn the hard way that people tend to clash regardless of the environment.Challenges to an Entrepreneurial PathThere are other reasons you may want to steer clear of the entrepreneurial path. First, there’s the sheer difficulty of finding a market niche for your product or service, as well as the proper resources to make a new business happen. Then there are the minutiae. As the founder, you will find that anything and everything is your responsibility. You will oversee production, distribution, marketing, sales and turning a profit. You’ll have to manage employees and vendors, and pesky details like accounting, taxes, insurance and licenses.Would-be entrepreneurs who want to have a better work-life balance are in for a rude awakening. For at least the first few years, you may be on the job at all hours. If a customer has a problem in the middle of the night, you are the one who’s getting up to address it. And if the company goes under, you are solely accountable for that failure, sacrificing your financial livelihood in the process.These days, the traditional business world gets a bad rap. But there are some highly valuable aspects of regular jobs that we don’t think about until they are gone. These are the three P’s: peace, prestige and perks.When you are one employee out of 1,000 or 100,000, you have much more peace. It’s actually possible to leave your work woes at the office and turn off your BlackBerry without jeopardizing the company’s future. Life is simpler. You have a defined set of responsibilities, and if you carry them out well and get results, you can go about your business with the certainty that the rest of the company can take care of itself.And if you are intelligent and personable, you can rise to a respectable place in an esteemed organization. Your friends and family won’t fidget nervously when you tell them about your job. Being able to put a known company on your résumé equals credibility and opens career doors.Remember the PerksFinally, don’t forget about the perks. At a large organization, your compensation package is just that: a package. Besides base salary, the money your employer contributes to your health insurance and retirement plans can be essential to surviving in today’s world. And don’t discount the value of possible benefits like cars, gym memberships, child care, on-the-job lunches and big discounts on company products.The corporate world also gives you the opportunity to be around lots of people all the time. And, inevitably, some will be executives in a position to help with your career. The ability to establish relationships with powerful people in the context of your daily work is the best kind of networking out there.The entrepreneurial lifestyle isn’t for everyone. It wasn’t for Cleary, and it may not be for you. Before you decide to take the plunge, think long and hard about what you’ll be getting yourself into, and what you’ll be giving up.",11:31.9

Any deal wouldn't happen before September 2021, Dell said.In addition to greater partnership opportunities, operating independently could make VMware a more attractive destination for top talent and give the company more freedom to do deals, Gelsinger said.""I can't effectively use my equity for acquisitions today,"" he said.

He also led a partnership with Amazon Web Services in 2016, so customers could use a combination of cloud and on-premises services for their workloads.After the coronavirus pandemic forced companies to close their offices, some VMware customers became more reliant on cloud services from AWS. That theme has played out across the cloud infrastructure landscape. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in April that ""we have seen two years' worth of digital transformation in two months,"" referring to sales, customers service and security all moving into ""a world of remote everything.""VMware's license revenue dropped 7% in the quarter that ended July 31, compared with 2% growth in the prior quarter.

62,Amazon and Google are going to be in every aspect of your life whether you want them to or not,2019-01-11T18:29:51+0000,Todd Haselton,"Until recently, Amazon and Google competed for presence in our homes through their own gadgets: Smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, TV add-ons like Chromecast and Fire TV and even home security systems like Nest and Ring.But, at CES 2019, that competition was brought to a boil as partners from both companies launched dozens of products that will bring Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant into nearly every aspect of our lives.I've been attending CES for more than a decade, and it's always home to all sorts of new doohickeys, from robots to health trackers and the latest in TV technology. While those things were all on display this year, too, I couldn't help but notice the massive presence of Google and Amazon, two companies that didn't even exist at CES a couple of years ago.

While those things were all on display this year, too, I couldn't help but notice the massive presence of Google and Amazon, two companies that didn't even exist at CES a couple of years ago. That's because their smart assistants, the ones you can control by voice, are being built into almost every category of new product that was introduced at CES, from TVs to ovens — even lawnmowers and a toilet.Google tripled the size of its booth this year, where it even had a roller coaster that brought riders through an experience that explained how you can use Google Assistant throughout the day, from getting directions and traffic information to ordering food and snapping a selfie.Amazon had three different booths. There was one for ""Key by Amazon,"" which showed how you can have packages delivered inside your house, into your car and — new this year — into your garage. It also had a booth dedicated to Ring, its home security system, that showed off a range of new products like security cameras and lights. Amazon also had an entire room where it had an array of products from its partners, including smart glasses, coffee machines, ovens and more, all with Alexa built-in.Both firms also revealed how widespread their ecosystems are.Google said that by the end of January, more than 1 billion devices will have Google Assistant built-in. That's up from 500 million in May, but a lot of that growth is because Assistant now ships as a standard feature on Android phones. Google Assistant is also built into 10,000 different smart home devices from more than 1,600 brands, the company said.Amazon said there are now more than 150 products with Alexa built directly in — which means you can talk right to it without also owning an Echo — and more than 28,000 products from 4,500 brands that support it. That means you need an Amazon Echo to control the gadget. Amazon also said it has now sold more than 100 million Alexa devices.There's a reason the number of products that support the assistants is skyrocketing.Last year, Amazon introduced a developer kit that made it much easier for partners to add Alexa to their devices. It showed this with a proof of concept microwave that it now sells. If a partner decides to add Amazon Dash integration, then it can be used to automatically order more supplies when you run low, like more detergent for your Alexa-powered dishwasher. Google also introduced similar tools for developers.By pure booth presence alone, Google left the biggest impression on me at CES. I've just never seen a roller coaster in a booth. But, and this was clear walking around the show, more brands and products were on display with Amazon Alexa on board. Some supported both.For consumers, this means that as you shop for new products in the coming years, whether it's a car or TV or a home appliance, you'll probably see Alexa or Google built-in, even if you don't necessarily want to use it. If you do, you'll be able to tell Alexa to start the dishwasher or ask Google to set your oven to 375 degrees.And this means that Amazon and Google are becoming nearly omnipresent, whether you want them to be or not. Since Alexa and Google Assistant learn from what you ask of them, that means Amazon and Google will be able to learn more than ever about you and your habits. And for them, that's big business. It gives Amazon the ability to gather data on your purchasing habits and recommend more items you're likely to buy. And Google will learn more about you for its targeted advertising business.",11:32.4

The forecasters expected the headline consumer price index (CPI)  would rise 1.0 percent next year. The survey found the Singapore dollar was expected to weaken further against the greenback, with the average forecast expecting the U.S. dollar to be fetching around 1.465 Singapore dollars at the end of 2017.

In the survey, the forecasters also cut their outlook for this  year's growth to 1.4 percent from 1.8 percent in the September  survey. That followed third-quarter growth coming in weaker than  expected at 1.1 percent on-year, below the September survey's  forecast of 1.7 percent.   The forecasts for 2016 growth ranged from 1.1 percent to 1.6  percent.   The economists now expected the finance and insurance sector  would grow just 0.5 percent in 2016, down from 2.0 percent in the  previous survey.

The private consumption growth forecast was cut to 1.4 percent  for this year, down from 3.0 percent in the September  survey.   The headline consumer price index was expected to fall 0.5  percent for the full year, with the forecast unchanged from  September.  For the fourth quarter of 2016, economists expected just 0.6  percent on-year growth on average, with a median forecast of 0.8  percent.

New York is just a far more competitive place than Toronto when  it comes to top-quality investment professionals. There are more opportunities for making tremendous amounts of money. If  you're a New Yorker who can generate consistent 9.6 returns  without leverage, you can easily raise money for a hedge fund  that will make you a millionaire. What's more, the Canadian fund has benefited from that country's real  estate boom. It owns a lot of assets that have risen in value  with the home and commercial real estate market. If Canadian  real estate crashes—as some expect it will—the fund  performance will probably suffer.The average return on the S&P 500 for the past decade is 7.6  percent, which means that a simple index fund could achieve much  of the gains that New York's pension funds need to remain  solvent.

Both totals were the best either automaker had seen since 2007, before the U.S. economy went into recession and caused a drastic decline in sales that led GM and Chrysler to file for bankruptcy in 2009.Still, results of Ford, Chrysler and Toyota came in below expectations, while GM missed some analysts' estimates, suggesting that the U.S. industry will have a hard time reaching the 14.9 million-vehicle annual sales rate economists had predicted for the month before Sandy pummeled the U.S. East Coast.  Auto sales are an early indicator each month of U.S. consumer demand.The massive storm, which hit New York City on Monday evening, hurt U.S. demand at the end of the month, with Ford officials estimating the lost sales for the entire industry at 20,000 to 25,000 vehicles.Ford officials said that would hurt the annual rate by 300,000 vehicles, although analysts have said the industry would likely make up any lost sales in November. GM officials agreed, saying Sandy hurt the annual rate by at least 300,000 vehicles.GM said it sees an October annual sales rate in the range of 14.4 million vehicles. Ford estimates the rate in the high 14 million range including heavy and medium-duty trucks, in line with GM.Volkswagen AG's U.S. operations chief, Jonathan Browning, said the industry would fall short of the 10 to 11 percent gain many had predicted.``This is not yet a full-blown recovery,'' Browning told reporters on a conference call. ``The overall environment is one of improving optimism, but it's still not a strong positive development in terms of the overall economy.'' He added that demand had been choppy in some regions even before Sandy.Before the massive storm hit, analysts had predicted the industry would show an 11 percent sales gain, led by Toyota and Honda Motor Co, which benefited from increased demand for compact cars as gasoline prices remained high across the country.Many automakers still made gains in the month as rising home prices, attractive vehicle financing options and Americans' growing need to replace their aging cars spurred more consumers to showrooms. That bodes well for the future, a top GM executive said.``Year over year, the light vehicle selling rate has increased for eight consecutive quarters without a tailwind from the residential housing sector, but that is starting to change,'' Kurt McNeil, GM's vice president of U.S. sales operations, said in a statement. ``If these trends continue, housing may be the final piece of the puzzle that lifts sales above 15 million units on an annual basis.''Over the last five years, the U.S. auto sector has undergone a wrenching overhaul that led to plant closures, job losses and the government-financed bankruptcy restructurings of GM and Chrysler. Ford also overhauled its U.S. operations, but did not take a government bailout.The October sales report will be the last before Election Day, marking the end of a contentious U.S. presidential race that has repeatedly thrust GM and Chrysler into the spotlight in televised debates, stump speeches and campaign advertisements.The sales report also caps a busy week for the U.S. auto industry, which saw third-quarter profit reports from all three Detroit automakers.GM shares were down 0.6 percent at $25.34 on Thursday morning, while Ford shares were down 1.4 percent at $11.00.

AGL said in a statement that it was also negotiating with Babcock & Brown to acquire the retail business, but stated that it has not entered an agreement with either party. AlintaAGL, spun off in an asset swap deal between AGL and Alinta last year, is a joint venture company that holds Alinta's Western Australia retail and generation businesses. Macquarie Bank said in a separate statement that it was still considering acquiring Alinta, which had put itself up for sale after receiving a management buyout proposal in January.

Alinta's board had rejected the proposal, saying  the deal included shares in an untested new vehicle. Under the agreement with AGL, Macquarie would sell to AGL the AlintaAGL power retailing business AGL does not already own in exchange for AGL agreeing to sell to Macquarie its interests in several Alinta generators, according to newspaper reports. Macquarie may be planning to use the proceeds of any AGL deal, which could be about A$400 million, to fund a cash return to Alinta shareholders as part of a sweetened offer. A source familiar with the situation said there was a Friday deadline for Macquarie to return information it had access to on Alinta, but that did not mean it had to submit an offer by Friday. Another source said Macquarie was still working on finalizing an underwriting package for a bid. Babcock offered Alinta shareholders A$8.50 in cash per share as well as 7.83 shares of Babcock & Brown Infrastructure, 1.30 shares of Babcock & Brown Wind, 3.31 shares of Babcock & Brown Power and 1.51 Australia Pipeline Trust units for every five Alinta shares.

Both appearances were on successive days last month.Asked by a House Oversight investigator whether Conrad, the North Dakota senator, ""was aware that he was getting preferential treatment,"" Feinberg answered: ""Yes, he was aware.""Referring to Dodd, the investigator asked:""And do you know if during the course of your communications"" with the senator or his wife ""that you ever had an opportunity to share with them if they were getting special VIP treatment?""""Yes, yes,"" Feinberg replied.The senators were VIP borrowers in the program known as ""friends of Angelo."" Angelo Mozilo was chief executive of Countrywide, which played a big part in the foreclosure crisis triggered by defaults on subprime loans. The Calabasas, Calif.-based company was bought last July by Bank of America for about $2.5 billion.Bryan DeAngelis, Dodd's spokesman, said Feinberg has repeatedly made allegations of special treatment that were not true.""As the Dodds have said from the beginning, they did not seek or expect any special rates or terms on their loans and they never received any. They were never offered special or sweetheart deals and if anyone had made such an offer, they would have severed that relationship immediately.""DeAngelis also repeated Dodd's statements from February that an independent report showed the terms received by the senator and his wife were widely available at the time.Conrad's spokesman, Chris Gaddie, said Monday that the senator ""never asked for, expected or was aware of loans on any preferential terms"" and has ""worked overtime to set the record straight.""""He went with Countrywide simply because they already had his financial information,"" Gaddie said. He added that a Countrywide official had told Conrad that ""it is not unusual for them to make exceptions for good customers if they could sell the loan in the secondary market. We now know that they did sell the apartment building loan in the secondary market.""Feinberg said in his House testimony that it was hard for ""friends of Angelo"" to fail to see their special treatment, because the loan officers identified themselves as part of the VIP unit.""When the loan comes out of the VIP processing unit their business cards are stapled in loan packages,"" Feinberg said. ""It says 'VIP Supervisor,' VIP underwriter.' ""Everyone's VIP, so I'm just thinking human nature is to think, well, what am I getting?""Q. So as I understand what you're saying is, it was the pattern and practice of the account executives that handled VIP loans?A. Yes.Q. To notify the borrower.A. Right.Q. Of the preferential treatment they were receiving.A. Right.At a Feb. 2 news conference, Dodd said he knew he was in a VIP program but insisted he was told by Countrywide, ""It was nothing more than enhanced customer service ... being able to get a person on the phone instead of an automated operator.""The ethics committee determines whether senators violated standards of conduct. The outcome of the investigation could hinge on whether the mortgage violated strict limits on gifts to lawmakers or ran afoul of other Senate rules. The committee typically just issues a report. It could recommend a censure vote by the Senate, but that is rare.Feinberg was questioned closely by three of the ethics committee's six senators: Democratic Chairman Barbara Boxer of California; the panel's senior Republican, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, and Republican Jim Risch of Idaho, according to Goldstein, the Feinberg attorney.The ethics questioning was intense at times, and Boxer asked the bulk of the questions, Goldstein said. When Feinberg described a conversation he had with Dodd, Boxer demanded to know how he remembered it. Feinberg said he recalled Dodd saying he had to leave to make a speech.Boxer asked whether Dodd and Conrad received VIP treatment because they were senators. Feinberg said that was not the case; they received breaks as other influential people in Countrywide's ""friends of Angelo"" VIP program.Isakson, a onetime real estate executive, asked more detailed questions about the mortgage agreements' terms.Countrywide VIPs, Feinberg told the committees, received discounts on rates, fees and points. Dodd received a break when Countrywide counted both his Connecticut and Washington homes as primary owner-occupied residences — a fraction, according to Feinberg. Conrad received a type of commercial loan that he was told Countrywide didn't offer.""The simple fact that Angelo Mozilo and other high-ranking executives at Countrywide were personally making sure Mr. Feinberg handled their loans right is proof in itself that the senators knew they were getting sweetheart deals,"" said Feinberg's principal attorney, Anthony Salerno.Conrad initially said in June 2008, ""If they did me a favor, they did it without my knowledge and without my requesting it.""The next day, Conrad changed course after reviewing documents showing he got special treatment and said he was donating $10,500 to charity and refinancing the loan on the apartment building with another lender.He also said then it appeared Countrywide had waived 1 point at closing on the beach house.",11:33.5

75,Strong jobs report is not enough to ease recession fears,2016-07-08T09:29:58-0400,,"Nonfarm payrolls rose 287,000 in June, significantly more than expected according to the median consensus on Bloomberg, and certainly a welcome improvement from the minimal rise last month.  May, in fact, was revised down further from 38,000 to just 11,000.  Taking the Verizon strike into account, adding 35,000 to May and subtracting 35,000 from June, the last two months of payroll gains are more like 46,000 and 252,000 respectively.   Still, the improvement at the end of the second-quarter does little to reinstate a positive trajectory in hiring – remember it's not about just one or two months data, it is about the trend pace.  The three-month average rose from 115,000 to 140,000 in June, down markedly, however, from a near 300,000 pace at the end of 2015 when the Fed opted to raise interest rates for the first time in nine years.  In other words, while the Fed's preemptive policy adjustment was based on expectations of further improvement in the labor market and inflation, the data have still-failed to evolve as expected.    The unemployment rate ticked up from 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent in June as nearly half a million workers moved back into the labor force – nearly the same amount that dropped out the month prior.  Household employment rose, however, by only 67k in June prompting a rise in the unemployment rate, as well as the participation rate from 62.6 percent to 62.7 percent.  Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent in June, enough, however, to boost the annual pace of earnings up to 2.6 percent, a new high for 2016.  If sustained, which is itself a big if, positive, above-trend earnings growth would offer the Federal Reserve at least one strong indication of continued improvement in the U.S. labor market.  As of late, however, it is still too soon to suggest a sustainable upward trend as wages have been increasingly volatile month-to-month.  Finally, the workweek remains unchanged at 34.4 in June, as if has for the past five months.  Here's the bottom line:  Prior to the violent reaction in the financial markets following the Brexit, several Committee members noted the downside risks to the Fed's outlook for growth in economic activity and for further improvement in labor market conditions.  This morning's June employment report, while a welcome improvement from a disappointing rise in May, has done little to help quell the Committee's well-founded concerns surrounding labor market strength or the market's concerns of a recession over the next 12-24 months.  After all, although the headline increase in May was severely disappointing and seemingly an anomaly, the pace of hiring has been slowing for some time.  Near 300,000 at the end of last year, the three-month average slowed to fewer than 200,000 in the first quarter before dropping to just above 100,000 as of late.  Thus, even the outsized nominal rise in June of 287,000, beating market expectations, is not enough to reestablish an improving trend in hiring.  Rather, a still-weakened trajectory will continue to fuel the Committee's concerns surrounding the underlying momentum of the U.S. labor market, and the domestic economy as a whole, into the second-half of the year and beyond, perpetuating the Fed's inability to raise rates anytime soon.  In other words, if rates were poised to stay low for longer, the Fed's acknowledgement of recent weakness on the domestic front coupled with global market volatility suggest rates are now likely to be much lower for much, much, much longer.

Donald Carty, chairman of Virgin America and former AMR chairman and CEO, noted ""there's very little expectation about [Thursday's] speech or anything that will happen in the next eighteen months.""Lack of confidence is a result of the government's inability ""to delvelop a plan to fix these problems,"" he added.

This economy is 70 percent consumer driven, so we need consumers spending some of their discretionary income if we're going to have demand that's gong to lead to more jobs.""""If we get demand, we’ll put more shifts on, our employees will be working more hours, and we’ll hire more people. Without demand we can have all the certainty in the world and all the clarity about regulation, but to me it’s not so much about confidence as it is about demand,"" explained Faraci.Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo, noted that ""anything that's done to address unemployment in terms of massive stimulus spending is going to exacerbate deficits. And anything that's done to address deficits in the short-term is going to exacerbate unemployment.""Nooya went on to say we're in ""a bit of a policy box and it's going to require us being willing to give up one of the two, which is it's okay to take on more deficits but lets put in some massive spending. Alternatively to say, 'we're going to go through structural unemployment for a while because we want to address deficits.'""At this point I think we are all trying to address this conundrum by saying we have to address both sides, unfortunately there is no way out of this,"" Nooya added.Michael George, CEO of QVC, noted the importance of ""making sure that there's a tax code and an investment code that supports the formation and growth of small businesses.""

They might need the cash for a big personal purchase such as a new house or yacht, or they might need the cash to fund a charity. Sometimes they sell as part of a planned selling program that they have put in place for diversification purposes, which allows them to sell stock in stages instead of selling all at one price. Other times they sell because they think their stock is overvalued and the risk/reward is no longer attractive. Some even dump their own stock because they have inside knowledge that a competitor is eating their lunch and stealing market share. But insiders usually buy their own shares for one reason: They think the stock is a bargain and has tremendous upside.   The key word in that last statement is “think.” Just because a corporate insider thinks his or her stock is going to trade higher, that doesn’t mean it will play out that way. Insiders can have all the conviction in the world that their stock is a buy, but if the market doesn’t agree with them, the stock could end up going nowhere. Also, I say “usually” because sometimes insiders are loaned money by the company to buy their own stock. Those loans are often sweetheart deals and shouldn’t be viewed as organic insider buying. At the end of the day, its large institutional money managers running big mutual funds and hedge funds that drive stock prices, not insiders. That said, many of these savvy stock operators will follow insider buying activity when they agree with the insider that the stock is undervalued and has upside potential. This is why it’s so important to always be monitoring insider activity, but it’s twice as important to make sure the trend of the stock coincides with the insider buying. Recently, a number of companies’ corporate insiders have bought large amounts of stock. These insiders are finding some value in the market, which warrants a closer look at these stocks. Here’s a look at several stocks that insiders have been doing some big guying in per Securities and Exchange Commission filings.1. IMAXOne stock that insiders are snapping up a huge amount of is Imax, which, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries, operates as an entertainment technology company specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations worldwide. Insiders are loading up on this stock into strength, since shares are up a whopping 38 percent so far in 2012. Imax has a market capitalization of $1.67 billion and an enterprise value of $1.62 billion. This stock trades at a premium valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 89 and a forward price-to-earnings of 22.38. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 135 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 21.3 percent. This is not a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $21.59 million, and its total debt is $55 million. A beneficial owner just bought 183,600 shares, or about $4.3 million worth of stock, at $22.62 to $24.11 per share. This same beneficial owner also just bought 326,400 shares, or about $7.49 million worth of stock, at $22.91 to $23.04 per share. From a technical perspective, IMAX is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish. This stock recently bounced right off its 50-day at $22.50 a share, and it has now started enter breakout territory, with the stock moving above some near-term overhead resistance at $25.12 to $25.34 a share. That move started on Tuesday, and it was accompanied by massive upside volume of 3.34 million shares. If you’re bullish on IMAX, then I would look for long-biased trades once it triggers its next major breakout trade above some past overhead resistance levels at $26.48 to $26.68 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that breakout that registers near or above its three-month average action of 1.3 million shares. If we get that move soon, then IMAX could easily spike north of $30 a share. I would avoid IMAX or look for short-baized trades if it fails to hold that near-term breakout over $25.12 to $25.34 a share, and then drops back below its 50-day at $22.50 and 200-day at $21.58 with high volume. If we get that action, then look for IMAX to trend back below $20 a share. 2. Synageva BioPharmaIn the biotechnology and drugs complex, insiders are loading up on Synageva BioPharma, which is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with life-threatening rare diseases and unmet medical needs. Insiders are buying this stock into some big-time strength here, since shares are up over 80% so far in 2012. Synageva has a market cap of $1.04 billion and an enterprise value of $903 million. This stock trades at a premium valuation, with a price-to-sales of 235.20 and a price-to-book of 6.85. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 78.6%, and for next year it's pegged at — 51.10 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $138.92 million, and its total debt is zero.A director and beneficial owner just bought 886,000 shares, or about $36.5 million worth of stock, at $41.20 per share. Another director also just bought 73,000 shares, or about $3 million worth of stock, at $41.20 per share. From a technical perspective, Synageva is currently trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bullish. This stock triggered a major breakout trade back in late June once it started to move above some past overhead resistance at $40.38 with massive upside volume. Following that trigger, shares of Synageva pulled back briefly to around $40 a share, and then took off to hit its recent 52-week high of $49.93 a share. That move has started to push Synageva into overbought territory, since its current relative strength index reading is 80.42. If you’re in the bull camp on Synageva, then I would wait for this stock to pullback significantly since it’s extended by almost 10 points above its 50-day moving average of $39.28 a share, and it’s almost 20 points above its 200-day moving average of $30.36 a share. Look for a buying opportunity in Synageva once it pulls back closer to its 50-day moving average of $39.28 a share, at let’s say $42 to $40 a share if we get it. 3. Deckers OutdoorInsiders are also snapping up a large amount of stock in Deckers Outdoor, a designer, producer, marketer, and brand manager of footwear, apparel, and accessories. Insiders are sniffing out some deep value here, since this stock has traded down by over 35 percent so far in 2012. Deckers Outdoor has a market cap of $1.80 billion and an enterprise value of $1.55 billion. This stock trades at a cheap valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 9.79 and a forward price-to-earnings of 8.62. Its estimated growth rate for this year is -11 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 20.6 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $228.57 million, and its total debt is zero. The CEO just bought 10,000 shares, or around $459,000 worth of stock, at $45.90 per share. From a technical perspective, Deckers is currently trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bearish. This stock has been stuck in a nasty downtrend for the past eight months, with shares plunging from over $118.90 to a recent low of $42.16 a share. During that sharp move lower, shares of Deckers have consistently made lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. That said, the stock has started to reverse that trend and make higher lows and some higher highs. That move is quickly pushing Deckers within range of triggering a near-term breakout trade.If you’re bullish on Deckers, then I would look for long-biased trades once this stock manages to clear some near-term overhead resistance at $48.41 a share, and then its 50-day moving average of $50.15 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that’s tracking in near or above its three-month average action of 1.9 million shares. If that breakout triggers soon, then Deckers could easily re-test and possibly take out its next significant overhead resistance levels of $54.88 to $59.07 a share. Keep in mind that we will need to see a high-volume trend above its 50-day to have any chance at hitting those targets. On the flipside, I would avoid Deckers or look for short-baized trades if the stock fails to trigger that breakout soon, and then takes out its near-term support zones at $45 to $43.92, plus its 52-week low of $42.15 a share with high volume. If we get that action, then Deckers could slide back below $40 a share if the bears gain full control of this stock. Keep in mind that it’s almost always bearish technical action when a stock continues to print new 52-week lows.4. Verifone SystemsAnother stock that insiders are finding attractive here is business equipment player VeriFone Systems, which is engaged in the secure electronic payment solutions. It provides solutions, and services for the financial, retail, hospitality, petroleum, transportation, government, and health-care vertical markets. Insiders are finding some deep value here, since this stock is down by over 33 percent in the last three months. VeriFone has a market cap of $3.84 billion and an enterprise value of $5.13 billion. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 16.7 and a forward price-to-earnings of 10.96. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 38.5 percent, and for next year it's pegged at 22.2 percent. This is not a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $366.40 million, and its total debt is a whopping $1.61 billion. The CEO just bought 155,000 shares, or around $5.03 million worth of stock, at $32.50 per share. From a technical perspective, VeriFone is currently trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which is bearish. This stock got hammered back in April, with shares plunging from a high of $55.89 to a recent low of $30.10 a share. During that massive drop, shares of VeriFone were constantly making lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. The stock also flashed a number of warning signs to longs with large gap downs on heavy volume. That said, the stock has started to find some buying interest near $30 to $32 a share, and it’s now making higher lows and higher highs. If you’re in the bull camp on VeriFone, I would look for long-biased trades if this stock can manage to trigger a near-term breakout trade above some overhead resistance levels at $36.78 to its 50-day moving average of $36.81 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that hits near or above its three-month average volume of 3.6 million shares. If we get that breakout soon, then VeriFone could start to fill a recent gap down that started near $44 a share. Some key levels to watch for are $40 a share which is near the low of the gap down day, and its 200-day moving average of $42.25 a share. If those levels get taken out with volume, then VeriFone could re-visit some more resistance at $47.82 a share. On the flipside, I would avoid VeriFone or look for short-biased trades if it fails to trigger that breakout soon, and then drops below some major near-term support at $34 a share with heavy volume. If we get that action, then VeriFone could head back towards $32 to $30 a share. Any future move below its 52-week low of $30.10 a share should be consider bearish price action, since most stocks that print new 52-week lows continue to do so for some time. 5. Hudson GlobalAnother stock with some interesting insider buying is Hudson Global, which provides specialized professional-level recruitment and related talent solutions worldwide. Insiders are buying this stock into some notable weakness, since shares are off by around 18 percent so far in 2012. Hudson Global has a market cap of $143 million and an enterprise value of $113.14 million. This stock trades at a reasonable valuation, with a trailing price-to-earnings of 18.71 and a forward price-to-earnings of 12.83. Its estimated growth rate for this year is -147.1 percent, and for next year it’s pegged at 318.8 percent. This is a cash-rich company, since the total cash position on its balance sheet is $24.93 million and its total debt is $1.04 million. A beneficial owner just bought 112,400 shares, or about $443,000 worth of stock, at $3.95 per share. The same beneficial owner also just bought 150,000 shares, or about $605,000 worth of stock, at $4.03 per share. From a technical perspective, Hudson is currently trading above its 50-day moving average and below its 200-day moving averages which is neutral trendwise. This stock took a dive off its April high of $5.98 to its recent low of $3.23 a share. During that large move lower, shares of Hudson were consistently making lower highs and lower lows, which is bearish technical price action. That said, the stock formed a double bottom in mid-June at around $3.23 to $3.30 a share. Since marking that bottom, shares of Hudson have soared back above its 50-day moving average of $3.96 a share. If you’re bullish on Hudson, then I would look for long-biased trades once this stock takes out its 200-day moving average of $4.61 a share with high volume. Look for volume on that move that registers near or above its three-month average action of 107,522 shares. If we get that move soon, then look for Hudson to trade back towards its next significant overhead resistance levels at $5.72 to $5.98 a share. It’s possible that Hudson could pull back to its 50-day at $3.96 a share before it challenges its 200-day. I would simply avoid Hudson if it fails to trigger that breakout, and then moves back below its 50-day moving average at $3.96 and some more near-term support at $3.78 a share with heavy volume. If we get that move, then Hudson could easily re-test its previous double bottom price levels at $3.30 to $3.32 a share. Any move below its 52-week low of $3.05 share should be considered bearish technical price action.—By TheStreet.com Contributor Roberto PedoneAdditional News: Lights. Camera. Invest!

China and Japan posted the lowest levels of contamination, between 12 and 20 percent.On a global level, cocaine traces jumped almost 20 percent compared to a similar study conducted two years ago, said Yuegang Zuo of the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth.""I'm not sure why we've seen this apparent increase, but it could be related to the economic downturn, with stressed people turning to cocaine,"" Zuo said in a press release.The scientists studied 234 bills from the US, which came from 17 cities. Money from larger cities, such as Boston and Washington, D.C., contained the most cocaine.Although a high percentage of the money was contaminated, the amount was not significant enough to raise any health concerns, Zuo said.""For the most part, you can't get high by sniffing a regular banknote, unless it was used directly in drug uptake or during a drug exchange,"" he said.",11:34.4

Kamala Harris, D-Calif., used the holiday to launch a presidential campaign that, if successful, would make her the first woman and the second black candidate to become president.Meanwhile, an annual rally to observe King's birthday held in the capital of South Carolina, a critical early-voting state in the Democratic primary, will feature two senators expected to seek the White House in 2020, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Former Vice President Joe Biden, who's weighing his own presidential bid, is set to speak at a King holiday event in Washington alongside former New York mayor and possible 2020 rival Michael Bloomberg. Two candidates who have already opened exploratory committees — Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York — will also appear at King-centered events.While the Democratic field for 2020 is only beginning to take shape, the year that would have marked King's 90th birthday gives the party's prominent members a valuable opportunity to address race and, potentially, draw a contrast between their own views and those of President Donald Trump, whose approach to questions of racial justice has sparked criticism from multiple minority groups since he took office.How Democratic contenders, both those officially in the race and those still mulling campaigns, celebrated the King holiday:Harris, a first-term senator and former California attorney general known for her rigorous questioning of Trump's nominees, opened the holiday by declaring her bid on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" She abandoned the formality of launching an exploratory committee, instead going all in on a presidential campaign.""I love my country,"" she said when asked what qualifies her for the presidency. ""And this is a moment in time that I feel a sense of responsibility to stand up and fight for the best of who we are. And that fight will always include, as one of the highest priorities, our national security.""Harris, 54, grew up in Oakland, California, a daughter of parents from Jamaica and India who were active in the civil rights movement.King, she said, ""was aspirational, like our country is aspirational. We know that we've not yet reached those ideals, but our strength is that we fight to reach those ideals. And that inspires me because it is true that we are a country that, yes, we are flawed, we are not perfect, but we are a great country when we think about the principles upon which we are founded.""Harris also cited her years as a prosecutor in asserting: ""My entire career has been focused on keeping people safe. It is probably one of the things that motivates me more than anything else.""The senator plans a formal campaign launch in Oakland in a week and will have her headquarters in Baltimore. She's already planning her first trip to an early primary state as a declared candidate. On Friday, Harris will travel to South Carolina to attend the Pink Ice Gala in Columbia, which is hosted by a South Carolina chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, which Harris pledged as an undergraduate student at Howard University. The sorority, founded more than 100 years ago, is a stronghold in the black community.",11:34.4
81,John Edwards: Is He The New Robert F. Kennedy?,2007-07-18T18:09:35+0000,John Harwood,"In mimicking Robert F. Kennedy's 1967 tour through impoverished American communities, John Edwards strikes a resonant chord with me. My father covered that Kennedy trip for the Washington Post. A photo from that experience hangs on the wall in the kitchen of my family home. But is he the Bobby Kennedyof the 2008 presidential race?Certainly the former North Carolina senator would like to be--and with good reason. RFK, in a different way than his brother JFK,has become a mythic Democratic hero. He had an ability to appeal across racial and income lines in ways any thinking Democrat could want to emulate. Some of the comparisons are apt. John Edwards has drawn flak forhis work with the Fortress Investment Group hedge fundand his $400 haircuts. Kennedy was a rich man too. Notwithstanding our sustained economic growth and booming stock market, poverty rates remain comparable to levels of a generation ago; in the most recent Census Data, from 2005, slightly more than 12 percent of the population is poor. The poverty population has become younger, as Medicare and Social Security have dramatically reduced economic deprivation among the elderly. Poverty among whites has fallen substantially, but they represent a declining proportion of the overall population. Just as RFK was in his day, Edwards stands widely accused of political opportunism. He likes to say that he's emphasizing poverty issues against the prevailing wisdom of political consultants, since there's little political upside in appealing to the poor when middle class votes and upscale executives' political contributions drive U.S. elections. In fact, there's a very large political benefit in championing the poor among Democratic primary voters. But Edwards has at least three big problems in trying to replicate Kennedy's political feat. One is that Barack Obama--the first African American candidate with a real shot at becoming president -- is for many voters already filling the RFK roles for many voters of both races. A second is that immigration has made Hispanic voters a growing proportion of the Democratic primary electorate, and so far Hispanic voters have flocked to Hillary Clinton. The third is that the composition of the Democratic electorate has changed. Many of the blue-collar Democrats Kennedy appealed to are now Republicans, drawn by the GOP's appear on social issues or security concerns. That leaves Democrats more dependent than ever on both the top of the income scale as well as the bottom; Democrats nearly broke even in 2006 among voters earning more than $100,000 a year. Edwards aims to appeal to both upscale and downscale voters at the same time. Despite his work at Fortress, he led other top Democratic candidates in embracing higher taxes on private equity and hedge fund managers. He's also pushing universal health care and a tougher line on U.S. trade policy. One early sign of the viability of his strategy will come in his third quarter fund-raising. So far he boasts some loyal allies from American business; wealthy telecommunications executive Leo Hindery is a top economic adviser. Tune in to CNBC's ""Street Signs"" this afternoon at 2:30, and we'll explore Hindery's assessment of the top populist in the Democratic race. Fyi: It's good to be back blogging after my vacation.

""Babe Ruth"" by Rossin, a 72-inch x 60-inch oil on canvas, uniquely captures the athlete during his early years with the New York Yankees.(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20121001/CL84559 )The painting was commissioned and donated to the Hall of Fame by national lease-to-own retailer Aaron's, Inc. in commemoration of opening its milestone 2,000th store Friday in the Bronx. Joe Torre, a legendary baseball manager and Major League Baseball's Executive Vice President for baseball operations, attended the grand opening event as Aaron's special guest and officially unveiled the portrait during a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Erik Strohl, Senior Director of Exhibitions and Collections for the Hall of Fame, was on hand at the event to accept the portrait.""We are thrilled by Aaron's donation of this extraordinary portrait, which is incredibly lifelike and unique,"" Strohl said. ""Babe Ruth is globally known as one of baseball's most popular figures that ever lived, and we always welcome new ways to pay tribute to his legacy. This portrait is especially appealing in how it portrays 'The Babe' as a young man, early in his career, in full color detail. Most photographs of Ruth are not only in black and white, but depict him later in his career. Babe Ruth comes to life in this portrait in a way we've never seen before, a testament to the wonderful work by the artist. You really have to see it to believe it.""Aaron's commissioned the painting by internationally acclaimed portrait artist Rossin, recognized for his lifelike pieces of world leaders including U.S. Presidents, Britain's royal family and celebrities.""On the occasion of opening our 2,000th store in New York City, we wanted to do something meaningful for the local community,"" said Ronald W. Allen, CEO and President of Aaron's. ""Yankees baseball is obviously close to the hearts of New York residents, and we wanted to give them a rare opportunity to be among the first to see this spectacular painting of Babe Ruth, up close and in person, before it finds its permanent home at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. Rossin's portraits are of the highest caliber, and we are extremely pleased the Hall of Fame is accepting our donation of the painting as the newest addition to its historic collection of baseball art.""A replica of the painting will continue to hang in the Bronx Aaron's store located at 3254 White Plains Road.

Rising demand as economies reopen has created similar problems all over the world, but economists argue that Brexit has exacerbated these issues for Britain.","cnbc, Articles, Border security, Customs, Northern Ireland, Energy industry, Energy, European Commission, EU, British Government, United Kingdom, Politics, Economy, Brexit, Europe Economy, World News, Europe News, Supply and Demand, Supply Chain Management, Europe Politics, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source","The U.K. has emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic to find itself faced with an onslaught of new economic crises that have left the country in ""a precarious position,"" experts have warned.A perfect storm of labor shortages, skyrocketing natural gas prices and global supply chain constraints have put the country in prime position for a difficult winter. Rising demand as economies reopen has created similar problems all over the world, but economists argue that Brexit has exacerbated these issues for Britain.A lack of workers is affecting a slew of industries across the country.Britain has an estimated shortage of 100,000 truck drivers, which haulage organizations have largely attributed to a post-Brexit exodus of EU nationals. The lack of truck drivers has disrupted deliveries, leading to empty store shelves, backlogs at ports and dry gas stations, which sparked a panic buying frenzy in September that lasted weeks.Other sectors have also warned of deepening labor shortages that are expected to damage the availability and price of goods in the runup to Christmas.Britain's National Pig Association has warned that up to 120,000 pigs face being culled within weeks because of a lack of butchers and abattoir workers.In a statement on Friday, the vice president of the U.K.'s National Union of Farmers said labor shortages across the food supply chain remained acute, while the CEO of the U.K. Warehousing Association said in September that industries including warehousing, engineering and transport were all experiencing severe worker shortages.At the end of September, the Confederation of British Industry — which represents 190,000 businesses — said its latest data showed 70% of companies were planning pay rises in a bid to tackle labor shortages.The U.K. government has issued thousands of temporary visas for truck drivers, butchers and agricultural workers, but some critics have argued that this is insufficient to lure foreign workers.Riccardo Crescenzi, a professor of economic geography at the London School of Economics, expressed some skepticism about the solutions being offered by the government.""Offering three-month [visas] might not work while the rest of the EU is booming because of the injection of resources allowed for its recovery plan,"" he told CNBC in a phone call. ""And there is not really an unemployment problem in the U.K., so I struggle to see where drivers would come from in the domestic economy.""Crescenzi said it was hard to know if the issues were temporary. ""Some of these shortages could become structural, and this is a problem that can seriously constrain future growth.""Sam Roscoe, senior associate professor in operations and supply chain management at the University of Sussex, warned that shortages would persist in the U.K. unless there were fundamental changes to the country's immigration system.""Brexit was sold as a vote on immigration independence, the U.K. labor market and making sure that everybody in the U.K. had jobs to go to, but the issue is we have 5% unemployment,"" he said via telephone. ""We've lost access to 27 member countries and the labor pool that was once available there, especially in terms of so-called low-skilled labor. I think that definitely puts us in a precarious position.""Roscoe said it would take years to get enough Brits trained and licensed to drive heavy goods vehicles. ""In the meantime, the reality is we're going to have labor shortages unless the visa rules change.""In a note on Thursday, Credit Suisse economists warned that U.K. consumers ""face headwinds in the next few months,"" including elevated inflation, supply shortages and the tightening of monetary policy.""We think real disposable incomes for the U.K. consumer can fall by about 1.5% in 2022, the biggest fall since 2011,"" the note's authors predicted.Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium, told ITV News Thursday that three in five CEOs said they would have to raise prices by the end of the year due to supply chain problems. Some 10% said they had already done so.Charalambos Pissouros, head of research at JFD Group, said he believed panic buying and supply shortages in the U.K. might also impact spending power by damaging sterling's value.""I see the risk surrounding the future of the British pound as tilted to the downside,"" he told CNBC. ""How severe any further tumble may be depends on how long the situation stays unresolved. Quick responses like the involvement of the British military could restore economic performance sooner than thought and halt sterling's fall, and this could also allow the Bank of England to proceed freely with its tightening plans.""It comes as Britain also faces an energy crisis. Several U.K. energy suppliers have collapsed since September as wholesale gas prices climbed to record highs. While the problem has affected markets worldwide, the U.K. is particularly vulnerable because of its reliance on gas; more than 22 million households are connected to the British gas grid.Meanwhile in Europe — which is also battling rising prices — the European Commission on Wednesday published a ""toolbox"" that member states could use ""to address the immediate impact of current [gas] price increases, and further strengthen resilience against future shocks.""Crescenzi told CNBC that the EU can count on the strength of its single market, ""which means global shocks like the gas price crisis can be dealt with more effectively with significantly more room for manoeuvre.""""Following Brexit, the U.K. could still coordinate its response to the crisis with its most important trade and investment partner to ensure the best possible protection for its firms and citizens,"" he added. ""However, measures put out by the U.K. government remain unclear, let alone a strategy to coordinate with external partners. This is alarming.""EU-U.K. relations have been under strain in recent weeks amid disputes over the Northern Ireland protocol, a special trade deal introduced to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Officials have publicly argued on Twitter over the proposals — dubbed the ""biggest source of mistrust"" between both sides by U.K. Brexit Minister David Frost — and met to discuss proposed changes in Brussels on Friday.",11:35.7

Tom Lydon, CEO of ETFTrends.com, told  CNBC producers this week that more than $2 billion has come into  the GDX in the last month. Read More  This could be the ultimate bull trap  One trade that stuck out to Khouw on Thursday was a hefty bet that the GDX could reach a new 52-week high by midyear.  Specifically, that trader purchased 50,000 of the June 22 strike  calls for 32 cents each. Since one call option accounts for 100  shares of stock, this is a $1.6 million bet that the GDX would be  above $22.32 by June expiration. That's nearly 40 percent higher  than where the ETF is currently trading.  ""It appears this trader is rolling out and up of a bullish  position, basically betting on continuing and substantial gains  in the gold miners over the next five months,"" said Khouw, co-founder of Optimize Advisors and a CNBC contributor.  The move in the miners this year is largely fueled by a surge in gold  prices. The commodity has rallied 9 percent in 2016, but  curiously enough it saw a similar rise in the first five weeks of  2015, only to sell off sharply as the year progressed.",11:36.2

""Europe is coming out of a crisis. Growth has returned to all but  one of the euro zone countries and it's picking up and becoming  broader. I think we should use this current stage to become more  shock-proof,"" he told CNBC in Lima, where the International  Monetary Fund/World Bank's annual meeting was being held.   ""In order to do that we need to extend and complete the banking  union, build a capital markets union to diversify the way finance  comes to our economy and we need to push forward with the  structural reforms to become even more competitive."" Read More  Europe's crisis of confidence  ""So for Europe, it's about getting more growth, increasing  potential growth and making sure we become more shock-proof,"" he  added.  Dijsselbloem's comments come as data point to a modest recovery  in the 28-member European Union. In the second quarter of 2015,  for instance, the EU and the 19-member euro zone grew at 1.6  percent and 1.2 percent percent respectively, from the same  quarter in 2014.  Still, some of the region's biggest economies, Germany and  France, have recently shown cause for concern, with lackluster manufacturing and  service sector output and growth data. While in the second  quarter, France had no growth at all from the previous quarter,  Germany grew a meager 0.4 percent.   Dijsselbloem appeared optimistic, however, saying that current  growth rates in Europe were ""defying the pessimists"" and that  several countries such as Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands and  Baltic countries were experiencing strong levels of growth.   In order to make those growth rates sustainable, however, Europe  needed to deal with the ""hindrances"" in its economy, he said.  ""We need to cut red tape, open up markets, make sure it's easier  for people to start businesses and easier to get finance. If we  deal with all these small, structural issues in our economy then  I'm sure we can increase that potential growth with four  percentage points.""- Written by CNBC's Holly Ellyatt, follow her on Twitter @HollyEllyatt.

Athens says its reforms will boost state revenues by 3 billion  euros ($3.3 billion) in 2015, partly by tackling tax evasion, but  that it will oppose any new ""recessionary measures"" such as  further wage or pension cuts.  As talks unfold, Finance Minister Varoufakis told Vima newspaper  on Sunday that the reforms would not include a rise in VAT, which  had been a concern on Greece's islands where rates are lower, but  changes to tax collection would be made.  Varoufakis was the centre of speculation on Friday following a  report in the German newspaper Bild that a Greek government  source had said it was only a matter of time before he resigned.  But Tsipras said Varoufakis was ""one of the key members of the  government"". China and Russia  As Greece races to agree to raise funds, Deputy Prime Minister  Yannis Dragasakis told China's official Xinhua news agency that  Athens will sell its majority stake in the port of Piraeus within  weeks, a flip-flop from its previous position.

And as Greece seeks to fill its state coffers, the Russian  ambassador to Athens told Kathimerini newspaper that Moscow would  examine any loan request from Greece, were it to be made.  Tsipras is due to visit Moscow on April 8 for talks with Russian  President Vladimir Putin but the Greek government has stressed it  is not seeking funding from the Kremlin.  On Saturday, Greece's energy ministry said Lafazanis will meet  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom Chief  Executive Alexei Miller on Monday in the capital, a week before  Tsipras is due to arrive.  The previous centre-right government had planned to accelerate  the sale of a 65 percent stake in gas utility DEPA, after an  initial attempt to sell to Gazprom in 2013 failed. Within days of  Syriza taking power in January, Lafazanis said he would scrap the  sale.  DEPA has previously negotiated with Gazprom in a bid to get  cheaper gas supplies and was one of the first European companies  to obtain a rebate in 2011.  The two countries, which are both Orthodox Christian, have  traditionally had good relations and Athens has never strongly  supported sanctions against Russia over the conflict in Ukraine.",11:36.4

But something else happened in those 351 days: Donald Trump  became the Republican party's nominee for president.

101,Shopping for a home? It will take a lot longer than you think because home prices are overheating,2018-02-13T05:00:00+0000,Diana Olick,"Homes today are selling in about 40 days on average, almost two weeks faster than a year ago. But it is taking a lot longer for shoppers to find a home to buy.Two-thirds of buyers are shopping for more than three months before signing a deal, according to a new survey from the National Association of Home Builders. Why so long? They can't find a home they can afford.Forty-two percent of buyers surveyed said prices were out of reach for the homes they wanted. Home prices have been rising at a fast clip in the past year – faster than income growth and inflation. The primary reason is a lack of homes for sale, especially lower-priced homes.""It's the inventory problem that we're having out there that is causing these long delays in pulling the trigger,"" said Rose Quint, assistant vice president for survey research at the NAHB. ""It's lack of affordability, although the other problems are serious as well.""About a third of those surveyed said they couldn't find a home with features they wanted or in a neighborhood they wanted. Back to prices though, 27 percent said they kept getting outbid on their offers. Bidding wars are now the rule, not the exception, in most major U.S. markets.Home prices rose in 92 percent of the nation's measured housing markets at the end of last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. Twenty-six markets (15 percent) saw double-digit increases in prices. That was more than in the third quarter.""These consistent, multiyear price gains have certainly been great news for homeowners, and especially for those who were at one time in a negative equity situation,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. ""However, the shortage of new homes being built over the past decade is really burdening local markets and making home buying less affordable.""The lack of supply should benefit the homebuilders, and it may be already. Mortgage applications to purchase a newly built home jumped 18 percent in January compared with a year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.""This complements other positive news on U.S. job growth suggesting that economic fundamentals are strong,"" said Lynn Fisher, MBA vice president of research and economics, in a release. ""Based on applications, we estimate that new home sales were running at a pace of 700,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis – the highest such estimate in our survey which began in 2013.""The jump in demand is sizable, but the number of new homes for sale is still below historical averages and far below the number needed to satisfy both new and pent-up demand. The largest generation, millennials, are now moving into their homebuying years in force, but clearly not finding what they can afford.""The whole industry has been clamoring for builders to increase their production, but they're trying,"" said Quint. ""The prices of lumber and labor and land are increasing so fast, they're constrained at the bottom, at how low a price they can really achieve.""The NAHB is predicting a 5 percent increase in new home construction in 2018 compared with 2017.

""Based on applications, we estimate that new home sales were running at a pace of 700,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis – the highest such estimate in our survey which began in 2013.""The jump in demand is sizable, but the number of new homes for sale is still below historical averages and far below the number needed to satisfy both new and pent-up demand. The largest generation, millennials, are now moving into their homebuying years in force, but clearly not finding what they can afford.""The whole industry has been clamoring for builders to increase their production, but they're trying,"" said Quint. ""The prices of lumber and labor and land are increasing so fast, they're constrained at the bottom, at how low a price they can really achieve.""The NAHB is predicting a 5 percent increase in new home construction in 2018 compared with 2017.

103,Market Insider/Tuesday Look Ahead,2008-03-18T01:15:41+0000,Patti Domm,"Stocks held their own Monday, even after the shocking demise of Bear Stearns. But the market no doubt benefited from the view of many investors that the Fed will deliver a hefty rate cut when it meets Tuesday. Right now, traders are betting on a full point rate cut by the Fed, which would take the target Fed funds rate to 2 percent. Just Friday, the Fed funds futures showed traders believed the Fed would cut by 0.75 percent. But the weekend rescue of Bear Stearns in a Fed-engineered buyout by JP Morgan  and other extraordinary moves by the Fed changed that view. Two investment banks report earnings before the bell Tuesday, and that news will also be key in setting the course for markets. Other important news includes producer price inflation data, due at 8:30 a.m., and housing starts, also reported at 8:30 a.m. One of the most encouraging events for stocks in recent sessions is the pricing Tuesday afternoon of the giant $18 billion Visa IPO. The offering is expected to price after the bell Tuesday, and start trading Wednesday. There has been some real investor excitement about the offering, which is expected to price between $37 and $42 per share. Earnings CentralGoldman  is expected to report first quarter earnings of $2.58 per share, a decline of 61 percent, on revenues of $7.47 billion, a 41 percent decline. Lehman is expected to report earnings per share of $0.72, a 63 percent decline, on revenues of $3.351 billion, a 34 percent decrease. The shares of financial institutions were under pressure Monday after the Bear Stearns news, with Wall Street's investment banks particularly hard hit. The S&P financial sector was down 1.5 percent. Lehman stock was the most tattered of all the firms as an uncomfortable level of rumors swirled around its shares. The stock at some points during the day was down more than a third, and it traded on volume of 224 million shares, nearly eight times its 10 day average of 33 million shares. Lehman battled back. CEO Richard Fuld said in a statement that the Fed's announcement Sunday that it would allow investment banks to use its discount window takes the liquidity issue ""off the table for the entire industry."" Previously, commercial banks were the only institutions that could use the Fed's short term borrowing window. Traders said the Fed's rule change was a big reason why stock trading was so orderly Monday. Lehman's CFO Erin Callan is expected to appear on ""Closing Bell"" Tuesday. Chop, ChopDeutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Joe LaVorgna is one who changed his view on the Fed and rate cuts over the weekend. He now expects a full point rate cut when the Fed announces its decision at 2:15 p.m. ""The only way I could see the Fed not going 100 (a full point) is if they accompany the 75 cut with their intention to purchase GSE debt, Fannie and Freddie debt,"" he said. Speaking of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Wall Street Journal was reporting late Monday that the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight is close to reducing capital requirements for the two companies, a move that would give the firms more flexibility in buying mortgages. ""Look at the Fed's action. They basically are telling you they are going to do something dramatic. I don't think 0.75 is particularly dramatic anymore. I think it has been priced into the market,"" he said. LaVorgna said the Fed's statement will likely note that there's still downside risk. ""The Fed is not going to worry about inflation. It's going to worry about growth...we're not out of the woods yet,"" he said. Market MayhemThe Dow finished 21 points higher at 11,972, after a nearly 200 point swoon.

The insurance contracts are expensive, difficult to understand (for both consumers and financial advisors), hard to get out of and arguably not in the interests of the millions of consumers who have bought them. Indeed, the sale of high-commission annuities has been flagged as one of the more egregious ways that financial advisors fail to act in their clients' best interests.Since the Department of Labor finalized its fiduciary rule (now in limbo) last year, annuity sales have fallen dramatically as brokerage firms and advisors anticipate that the products may not pass muster under a tighter regulatory standard.""Companies have been canceling products left and right because they don't live up to the standard of meeting clients' best interests,"" said Ric Edelman, executive chairman and founder of Edelman Financial Services. Like many advisors, Edelman helps clients undertake tax-free Section 1035 transactions that allow consumers to switch out of high-cost annuity contracts into less costly ones. ""With that exception, I never advise clients to purchase annuities,"" he said.Most fee-based financial advisors regulated as fiduciaries appear to feel the same way. David Yeske, managing director of registered investment advisory firm Yeske Buie, said that variable annuities have fallen out of favor with the fee-based advisors he regularly surveys for the Financial Planning Association.""The use of variable annuities has been declining for years, and that's probably representative of the fiduciary side of the advisory world,"" said Yeske.More from Investor Toolkit: How to set up a special needs trust Health costs an ever bigger part of retirement planning 5 risks that can crack your nest eggFor his part, Yeske is not categorically against fixed or immediate annuities that guarantee income streams for investors, but he has never used them for his own clients. He thinks the adverse tax treatment of variable annuities — the gains in all distributions from the contracts are taxed as ordinary income — makes them a bad idea for savers.""Variable annuities are a perfect machine for converting capital gains to ordinary income,"" he said. While the gains within a variable annuity portfolio are tax-deferred, they are ultimately taxed at up to 39.6 percent, versus the 15 percent capital gains tax rate. ""It's hard to find scenarios where the benefits of tax deferral justify getting taxed at the higher rate.""Not all fiduciary financial advisors pan annuities, however. Harold Evensky, head of Evensky & Katz and a trailblazer in the RIA industry, believes that low-cost immediate annuities offered by companies such as Vanguard will be crucial for retirees at risk of outliving their assets. Mark Cortazzo, senior partner of fee-based advisor Macro Consulting Group, thinks there are situations where annuity products are an effective solution for risk-averse consumers. While he has steered very few of his clients toward annuities recently, because of low interest rates and higher prices since the financial crisis, he thinks advisors who ignore all annuity offerings are failing their clients.""We have to get past the rhetoric,"" said Cortazzo. ""If you're a fiduciary and you don't consider annuity solutions, you're not doing your job.""There is currently about $2 trillion invested in variable annuity products alone, according to research firm Morningstar. With the oldest baby boomers now in retirement, those numbers may rise much higher. Like all investment product offerings, annuities have positive and negative aspects to them. Here are a few of the more prominent pros and cons.Guaranteed income. In their simplest form, annuities guarantee an income stream for buyers either now (immediate annuities) or beginning at a later date (deferred annuities). While diversified investment portfolios have a potential for higher growth and cost far less to create, there is no guarantee that the assets will retain their value.""Strategies to manage risk are not guarantees against catastrophes,"" said Cortazzo. ""If a portfolio account goes to zero, the insurance company still keeps sending out the checks.""Protection against longevity risk. People are living longer and there's a good chance that many people will outlive their investment portfolios. What's more, retirees who are drawing on their investments to support themselves run a market ""sequence of return risk.""In adverse markets, it can be very difficult to recover from losses if you're withdrawing from your account. Cortazzo points out that an investor who put $1 million into the  at the beginning of 2000 and began taking $5,000 out per month ran out of money this year.""If I'm drawing out 6 percent of my portfolio annually and the market drops 50 percent, I'm suddenly withdrawing 12 percent,"" said Cortazzo. ""An annuity takes the sequence risk and the longevity risk off the table.""Market upside participation with downside protection. Variable annuity contracts offer the insurance component of an income guarantee with the possibility of increasing the payout if markets do well. Most of the products have a reset provision that allows payouts to increase if markets go up.The terms of the contract reset to higher values but do not decrease if the market subsequently drops. Since the financial crisis, insurance companies have been paying customers billions to walk away from guarantees they priced prior to the crisis.High cost. Annuity products can be expensive. Simple immediate annuities and deferred-income annuities generally have upfront commission rates that range from 1 percent to 4 percent. More complicated products, such as variable annuities and fixed index annuities, can have upfront commissions of 7 percent or more.Between insurance charges (also called mortality and expense fees), underlying sub-account fees for variable contracts and administrative fees, overall annual costs can be more than 2 percent.Hard to understand. While immediate annuities are easy enough to understand, more complicated variable annuity contracts or fixed index contracts that offer the potential for participation in market upside can get very complicated. Contract riders that offer additional benefits at additional costs make things more confusing still. Disclosures have improved but are still difficult to fathom.Limited investment options. Variable annuity contracts limit the options you have for investing the portfolio. That can handicap your ability to grow the account and your payouts. The fees charged for the underlying investments — usually mutual funds — can be high.Surrender penalties. Annuities are long-term contracts, and it can be very costly to break the terms of the deal. Buyers of annuities have to wait until they are 59½ years old before they can withdraw money without a 10 percent penalty.They also have to wait six, eight or even 10 years after entering the contract before they can withdraw money from the account without additional surrender charges. The surrender charge period typically mirrors the commission level on the product: the higher the commission, the longer the surrender penalty period.  While many insurers now offer contract terms that will allow for early withdrawals from annuities without surrender penalties, it will cost you up front.Tax hit. While the investment gains in a variable annuity are tax-deferred, when the money is eventually withdrawn, the gains are taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains. For most people, that will result in a bigger tax hit. Withdrawals that are not part of a planned annuitization of the account per the terms of the contract will also be fully taxed as ordinary income until all the gains from the portfolio are distributed. Normally, annuity payments are comprised of taxable gains and non-taxable return of the principal invested.— By Andrew Osterland, special to CNBC.com",11:37.8

The department store chain announced Wednesday at its annual shareholders meeting in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, that it will offer full-service tire installation for orders from all tire brands on Amazon, including its own DieHard. News of the partnership sent Sears' stock soaring as much as 22 percent in early trading. The shares were last up 24 percent. The rollout will begin in the coming weeks for those customers who live within range of 47 Sears Auto Centers in eight metropolitan areas: Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. The service will eventually go live at Sears' more than 400 Auto Centers across the U.S., to reach more of Amazon's customers. The checkout process will look something like this, a Sears spokesman explained to CNBC: A customer selects the tires he or she wants, from any brand, on Amazon.  He or she selects ""Yes, I want these tires shipped to and installed at Sears Auto Center."" (The shipment of the tires to the Sears Auto Center would be handled by Amazon, not Sears.) The customer then provides three appointment times that are convenient for the installation. The chosen Sears Auto Center will then match the customer's schedule preferences with its appointment openings. Sears Auto Center then emails a confirmation through Amazon to the customer ahead of the appointment, which can still be altered. With any appointment, there will be a ""standard installation fee"" paid to Sears that covers installation, balancing, under hood/under car evaluation, a road safety test and other precautionary steps, the spokesman said. Sears kicked off its relationship with Amazon last summer when it announced it would begin selling Kenmore-branded appliances on Amazon, some of which are integrated with Amazon's Alexa platform. Shares of the department store chain had surged more than 25 percent on the news. Then, in December, Sears said it would begin selling merchandise from its DieHard brand on Amazon, including car batteries and now tires. ""Kenmore is now distributed nationally on Amazon with over 250 products and we are exceeding customer service level expectations,"" Tom Park, president of Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears Holdings, said in a statement. The company said it has about 2,100 technicians at its Auto Centers across the country to perform tire installations. Sears is meanwhile looking for ways to monetize other assets, as its sales are in a steep decline overall and the company has more than $1 billion of debt coming due within the year, according to financial statements. Sears CEO Eddie Lampert's hedge fund, ESL Investments, has made a proposal to buy Kenmore, Sears' home improvement business, its PartsDirect division and some of the chain's real estate. Lampert has said he's been shopping some of those assets for years, but hasn't been able to find a serious buyer. In a blog post Wednesday, prior to Sears' shareholders meeting, Lampert said: ""We're still not where we need to be, and Sears continues to face significant challenges in a tough retail environment. ... The reality is transformation is an ongoing process and we are not done. I still firmly believe that, together, we can transform this company.""

110,Mike Pence saved the Republican party after that Cruz disaster,2016-07-21T18:59:41+0000,,"Ted Cruz essentially gave a career-ending  speech at the GOP convention on Wednesday night.   Cruz's speech was a slap in the face to GOP nominee Donald Trump.  This whole business about ""vote your conscience"" — that's a  wonderful-sounding phrase.

I've been to most of the GOP conventions since 1980, and I've  never seen anything like it. These people stood on their feet and  booed. These are Republicans! They don't do this. They don't know  how to stand up and boo! And yet, Cruz so divided them and worked  them into such a frenzy that it happened.  Cruz tried to pass it off as just the New York delegation acting  up. But that is wrong. The whole hall was in an uproar. You  couldn't even hear the last two paragraphs of Cruz's speech  because the booing had reached such a crescendo!  Cruz left an absolute disaster in his wake when he finished that  speech. Everyone was dispirited — as you might expect.  And then came Trump running mate Mike Pence.  Pence delivered a terrific speech. He touched on all the major  themes — the economy, shaking up Washington and Trump being  an outsider. He talked about how Trump understands that middle  class wage earners have been hurt — they haven't had a raise  in 15 years.

That's something that Cruz, in all of his years of  political experience, still doesn't understand!  Really, in the space of about 10 or 12 minutes, Mike Pence turned  a demoralized, dispirited, depressed, negative convention into an  upbeat, optimistic, united convention. He hit all the right notes  and had a lot of optimism in his speech. The Cruz disaster, that  had left the convention hall spinning just moments before, was  suddenly swept away.  The entire hall started applauding Pence. Then they started  cheering for Pence. And they got on their feet and cheered for  Pence. Amazing.  Trump couldn't have made a better choice. Mike Pence  single-handedly pulled that convention back together and united  them with an optimistic message. He gave great support to Donald  Trump and the ticket. He basically snatched victory from the jaws  of defeat. He turned destruction into positive hope.  I've never seen anything like that.  Ted Cruz will never politically recover from this. His delegation  from Texas wanted him to play ball with Trump — and he  wouldn't. He was freelancing in that speech. And that is why his  political career is over. He's finished.  But Donald Trump and Mike Pence are just beginning.  We have to wait and see what Trump does tonight in his speech  — it could make or break his presidential campaign. I  personally hope that he puts a lot of focus on optimistic,  positive changes for America. I want to see a lot of growth in  that speech. I want to hear him talk about lowering taxes and  curbing regulations.   But here's what I want to see most of all: a follow-through from what Pence started. One of Pence's messages on Wednesday night was that we,  meaning the ticket, can turn this nation around. It's an American malaise right now — from the economy, to civil unrest, violence and the threat of terrorism. And that is what Trump must prove to the nation and the world — that he can turn it around. He's got to convince  them.  It's kind of like Reagan redux. Ronald Reagan was able to do  this. He proved that he could do the job. That's what Trump needs  to do.  That's huge. That's more important than any policy detail.  That's the spirit that Pence started on Wednesday night. Let's  hope Trump does the same.   Commentary by Larry Kudlow, a senior contributor at CNBC and  economics editor of the National Review.

If people don't know the business exists, they won't  walk through the doors—and a business location, staff and  start-up capital become irrelevant points.  Publicity can be acquired with billboard space or TV commercials,  but many small businesses just don't have that kind of money. For  mom and pops, a little creativity and a flair for the theatrical  can go a long way. In short, they need to rely on good  old-fashioned, attention-grabbing publicity stunts.  Some businesses have seen stunts become catalysts that take them  to the next level. Others see efforts fizzle out, and in some  cases turn into horrific disasters. But while there's no  guarantee a publicity stunt will accomplish what it's designed to  do, many businesses take that route anyway, always hoping for the  best.

Participants board the subway in  the middle of winter sans pants, to the great amusement of  surprised onlookers.This event presented the hair removal salon Shobha with a unique opportunity to  publicize their service. In January, The Manhattan-based salon sent a team of  pants-free participants to the event in underwear proudly bearing  the Shobha name.Many small businesses promote their services with prizes and  giveaways. Dating services are no exception, including Gotham  Dating Partners, which  offers a unique promotional item to new clients purchasing an  annual membership—a handgun.""We direct them to online sites and pay for the purchase,"" Gotham  Dating Partners CEO Aaron Fraser said in an e-mail. While clients are  required to pass background checks in order to be eligible for weapons, the site proudly matches gun enthusiasts.Rotterdam tattoo artist Dex Moelker caused a stir in 2011, when she gave a client a unique tattoo. The  client got the profile pictures of all 152 of her Facebook friends tattooed on her right arm, a process documented in a  YouTube video that went viral.Disappointingly, it was revealed by the Dutch newspaper Telegraaf  to be nothing more than a temporary tattoo. ""It is a try out tattoo, a transfer that washes off in a couple  of days,"" Moelker told the Telegraaf. However, the video has been  viewed more than 3.7 million times and is linked to from  Moekler's website, a testament to its publicity value two years  after the fact.  One of the most profitable movies ever made is 1999's ""The Blair  Witch Project,"" which had a production budget of $60,000 and a  worldwide box office take of over $248 million, according to  Box Office Mojo. The film was a fictional account of three film students'  experience investigating a centuries-old tale about a  witch.  ""The film was intended to be a fake documentary,"" co-director Daniel Myrick told Entertainment  Weekly. The movie was publicized a year in advance by  its website, which featured faked police reports  and staged interviews with ornery townsfolk. The advance  publicity fueled a widespread public perception and confusion  that the film was comprised of real footage, which only led both  horror fans and curiosity-seekers to purchase tickets in  droves.Cashtomato.com was a short-lived Internet video site whose founder allegedly intended that it compete with YouTube. A tall order, and one  that was addressed in a 2008 publicity stunt. It involved dressing up three representatives as tomatoes and having  them distribute $4,000 in cash to a packed mid-afternoon crowd in  Manhattan's Union Square. What could go wrong?The representatives were besieged by a seething mob of 100 people, who grabbed at the cash, injuring someone in the process,  according to the New York Daily News. Ultimately, the publicity stunt did not have the desired effect,  and the Cashtomato.com domain name is available for purchase  today.The German publishing house Eichborn Verlag performed an  attention-getting stunt at the 2009 Frankfurt Bookfair. Their  logo features a housefly, and the company harnessed the power of  the insect by attaching promotional banners to real live ones and  letting them loose in the venue.A video of the publicity event can be seen on YouTube. Witness the looks of simultaneous delight and irritation among attendees.LifeLock is an identity theft prevention company that used an  audacious tactic to publicize its services in 2007. It ran  television commercials in which CEO Todd Davis disclosed his real  social security number, a dare to identity thieves to  try their luck against the company.  One year later, ABC News reported that criminals did exactly that  by taking out a $500 payday loan in the CEO's name. It wasn't the only time either. In 2010, the Phoenix New Times  reported that his identity had been stolen a whopping 13 times.Half.com is an online seller of new and used goods founded in  1999 and purchased in 2000 by eBay. Unlike its parent company,  Half.com is not the place to outbid others for rare collectibles, but  rather a place to buy goods outright at fixed prices.In order to attract attention during its pre-eBay days, the company  paid the city of Halfway, Ore. $100,000 to change its name to  Half.com for one year. It also donated 20 new computers to the city to sweeten the deal  for its 362 citizens.  Syracuse, N.Y. is home to an ice hockey team known as The Crunch.  In December 2011, the team offered a spot on their roster to NBA player Kris  Humphries, who is perhaps best known as the man who was Kim  Kardashian's husband for all of 72 days.  As a tribute to Humphries' recently collapsed nuptials, the team  offered fans the chance to buy six tickets for $72, and Syracuse  Crunch General Manager Vance Lederman made a statement on the team's official website to make  the athlete feel welcome. ""Being from Minnesota, Humphries will  surely enjoy the hockey and feel right at home in the cold, gray,  dismal weather we experience this time of year in Central New  York,"" he said.

Although they have scaled back, detentions continue; Viasna reported scores of people were arrested in Minsk and in the city of Grodno on Sunday.Police and army troops blocked off the center of Minsk on Sunday, but demonstrators marched to the outskirts of the Palace of Independence, the president's working residence 3 kilometers (2 miles) outside the city center.

""The stronger euro could lead to such a heated debate that the ECB could postpone fall until the Indian summer period in late October,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING Diba, in a research note.""Either way, the big question for this week's meeting is whether Draghi will shed some light on the ECB's game plan for tapering,"" he added.","cnbc, Articles, EUR/USD, European Lithium Ltd, Jobs, Economy, World Markets, Europe News, Exchange-traded funds, Currency markets, Markets, Banks, Investment strategy, Business, World economy, Central banking, Politics, Central Banks, World Economy, Funds and ETFs, Investing, Currencies, Business News, Finance, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source","The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to hold off on making any announcements on its stimulus program when it meets this week, instead opting to push new developments to October in the face of a strong euro.President Mario Draghi said at the last ECB press conference that the Governing Council would discuss the future of its QE (quantitative easing) program in ""the fall"" - prompting many to speculate that he could detail a reduction of stimulus in September.However, with the fall technically only starting only at the end of September, these market participants may have gotten ahead of themselves.

The higher the euro, the more expensive products and services get for non-euro customers, which might affect exports from the currency union. At the same time it dampens inflation as imported goods get cheaper.""Putting more effort into explaining why the euro is rising on it and on how the balance sheet will continue to deliver stimulus even after tapering could allow for gradual tapering,"" said ECB watcher Anatoli Annenkov of Societe Generale in a note.""(The) core inflation forecast for 2019 is thus crucial,"" he added.On Thursday the ECB also will publish a new round of forecasts for inflation and growth. Given the higher euro, there could be a downward correction for inflation with possible market-moving effects.""Between the June and September projections, the euro has appreciated by some 4.2 percent, implying that the 2018 headline inflation forecast could be cut by some 0.2 percentage points to around 1.1 percent,"" said Annenkov.  So it will be up to ECB President Mario Draghi to explain why the ECB, despite the inflation outlook, thinks it is right to taper (gradually reduce stimulus).  A poll conducted by Reuters among 66 economists says that the majority expect the ECB to announce a scaling back of its QE program in October and to shut down the program altogether by the end of next year.""Tapering is (almost) unavoidable. In the discussion on the game plan, let us not forget that, due to bond scarcity, some kind of tapering in 2018 is almost unavoidable,"" added Brzeski.",11:38.8

For example, banks including HSBC and Barclays have said they will increase hiring in Asia, while cutting staff in developed markets.

Click ahead to find out.By: Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani(Posted: August 16, 2011)Companies Present: 55.7 percentOffice Rental Cost: $1,093 per sq. meterParis, one of the world's major cultural centers, is one of only three Western European cities to make the list of the world's top 10 business centers. France comes in third among European countries with the most international companies present.Paris, like its other Western counterparts, plays host to offices of many front-office business functions because of its advanced economy and high skills base. Professional services and the insurance sector have a large representation in Paris, while automobile and mining firms are the least represented. The city is home to French banking giant BNP Paribas and insurer AXA. In fact, the Paris region accounts for almost 30 percent of France's economy.Rents for office space rose 9 percent in 2010, despite ongoing economic debt worries in France and the wider Euro region. That's because a lack of new supply pushed commercial rents higher.Companies Present: 56.1 percentOffice Rental Cost: $524 per sq. meterDubai is the top business hub in the Middle East and African region, reflecting the success of its government's strategy to promote it as a regional center. The city has also benefited as a ""safe haven"" for foreign companies amid political unrest in the Arab world.Dubai attracted more than 70 percent of the firms polled by CB Richard Ellis in the industrial goods and services sectors. Given its strategic location—halfway between Europe and Asia—it often serves as the head office for higher-level decision-making.Incentives such as tax breaks and a more liberal attitude toward Western culture, such as women not having to cover their heads in public, have made Dubai a popular city for expatriate staff. The Dubai International Financial Centre, the firm running the emirate's tax-free business park, said 64 companies joined its free zone in the first half of 2011—an 8 percent increase from last year.But, there are some government restrictions that make it difficult for international companies to operate in the local market. For example, businesses must be 51 percent owned by a citizen of the United Arab Emirates.Dubai's property market has still not fully recovered from the Gulf state's property bust and debt crisis in 2009. In 2010, the Middle East and Africa were the only regions in the world that saw a continuing decline in office rental costs. Dubai saw rents go down by as much as 20 percent, as significant oversupply and high vacancy rates plagued the domestic market.Companies Present: 59.6 percentOffice Rental Cost: $484 per sq. meterMadrid is home to more than 75 percent of companies in the media, technology and telecommunications sector, about the same level as New York, giving Madrid equal bragging rights as a media capital. The city is also home to Telefonica—Europe's second-largest phone company.Madrid is the third largest city in the European Union (EU) after London and Paris, and accounted for more than 12 percent of Spain's gross domestic product in 2009. The city has held up better than the rest of the country, which has been facing a property bust and debt crisis. Its unemployment rate was 4.5 percentage points lower than the national average of 21.3 percent in the first quarter of 2011. Office rental prices have suffered though, dropping 7 percent in 2010 due to low demand.As the capital of the country, Madrid also benefits from Spain's popularity among foreign companies. In fact, Spain is among the top five countries in the world when it comes to attracting international companies. In all, Europe accounts for five of the top 10 nations in terms of hosting offices of the biggest international firms. A big draw for these companies is the size of the European consumer market and the ease with which companies in the EU can expand into neighboring countries.Companies Present: 60.4 percentOffice Rental Cost: $735 per sq. meterBeijing is one of the world's most heavily populated cities, with nearly 20 million residents. It's among five Asian cities that make the Top 10 list.The city has a high concentration of mining, construction, and agricultural companies. Firms that have a high level of interaction with government agencies and state-owned companies, as well as those in highly regulated sectors such as energy and mining, tend to set up an office in China's political center.Companies trying to access the growing local consumer markets also have a big presence in the city. Beijing's automobile sector has boomed in recent years, as China has become the world's largest car market by volume sales. German automaker Daimler opened a Mercedes-Benz design center in the city last month, while U.S. carmaker General Motors runs ventures with state auto groups SAIC Motor and FAW Group.Beijing has been rapidly developing prime office space following a government push to develop the central business district. Office rents went up by a whopping 48 percent in 2010 because of increased domestic demand for high-quality office space and limited supply.Companies Present: 60.7 percentOffice Rental Cost: $850 per sq. meterMoscow's ranking as the sixth most popular business hub, and the second most popular in Europe, shows Russia's importance as an emerging market.International firms find it difficult to do business in Russia without a domestic office, given high levels of bureaucracy and corruption, which is one reason why the city is so important for foreign companies. The fact the Moscow has better infrastructure and much higher levels of development than other large cities is another reason.The city of 13 million has a high concentration of companies in the professional services sector given its highly skilled labor force and the fact that it often acts as a hub for operations in Central and Eastern Europe.A redevelopment of Moscow's city center and the construction of the Moscow International Business Center have also helped cement the city's reputation as a hub.Companies Present: 61.4 percentOffice Rental Cost: $812 per sq. meterShanghai is home to China's major financial institutions and mainland stock exchange, receiving significant capital inflows from Hong Kong.Its position on the Yangtze River Delta also gives companies easy access to China's large manufacturing base, research and development, and back office operations in the region. These factors have resulted in a concentration of mining, construction, and commodity companies being based in the city. Many firms are starting to move west, however, to access cheaper labor.Government initiatives to reduce economic disparity between cities has led to better infrastructure in other regions, with the plan that Shanghai and Beijing will likely become service-based cities and the inland markets will manage the manufacturing and distribution functions.Shanghai has also becoming a key regional center in Asia. U.S. technology and manufacturing firm Honeywell moved its Singapore-based Asia-Pacific headquarters to the city in 2003, while German chip giant Infineon relocated its Hong Kong-based regional head office to Shanghai. As a result of growing demand, the city saw annual office rents rise by as much as 28 percent in 2010.Companies Present: 63.2 percentOffice Rental Cost: $1,683 per sq. meter (West End) or $974 per sq. meter (City)London has a long history as one of the world's top business centers, but in recent years a number of emerging markets have challenged its global ranking.The city still attracts the highest number of international companies in Europe and dominates in the banking, financial, and professional services sectors worldwide. London has more than 480 overseas banks and is home to multinational heavyweights such as Rio Tinto. The city has the most international visitors in the world and accounts for over 20 percent of the U.K.'s economy.Prime rents rebounded in London in 2010 after the global financial crisis. The city's West End saw annual rental growth top 27 percent due to limited supply of new construction. In comparison, rents in Ireland, Spain, and Greece fell by 19 percent, 7 percent, and 3 percent, respectively, in the same period.Companies Present: 63.9 percentOffice Rental Cost: $20,469 per sq. meterTokyo is home to 47 Japanese Fortune 500 companies, including Honda, Sony, and Mitsubishi. The city is also headquarters to several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies. It is also known as one of the three command centers of the world economy, along with New York and London. Often at the top of the world's most expensive cities list, Tokyo has faced several setbacks in recent years with stagnant economic growth and natural disasters crippling the Japanese economy.Tokyo slipped two places in 2010 to number three from being the most expensive office location in the world in 2009. Rents fell by more than 11 percent from the previous year as the city became a ""tenants market"" with vacancy rates rising and rental levels decreasing.Companies Present: 67.5 percentOffice Rental Cost: $850 per sq. meterSingapore is the highest ranked Asian city on the list. It has become a gateway for businesses and investors trying to access to world's fastest growing consumer markets in China.Being in the same time zone as key Asian markets, such as mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Indonesia, has been a major factor. The city is also home to two Fortune 500 companies—contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics and commodities trader Wilmar International.The island nation's high-quality infrastructure, efficient administration, low taxes, as well as its busy shipping port and airport, have made it a top choice for many international companies and their expatriate employees.The city is also home to many companies in the banking and financial services sector, and comes in fourth behind London, New York, and Hong Kong in terms of the number of financial services firms with offices there.Office rents went up as much as 16 percent in 2010, with further increases expected this year as corporations expand and demand continues to rise.Companies Present: 68.2 percentOffice Rental Cost: $2,297 per sq. meterHong Kong is the world's most popular city for international businesses, reflecting a shift in economic power to Asia in recent years.Hong Kong holds a unique position because of its location and lack of foreign ownership restrictions, which allow companies to operate globally and still have access to a highly skilled and low-cost workforce. Cities such as Hong Kong and Singapore are seen as key business hubs, with access to the anticipated growth in surrounding emerging markets. Leading financial multinationals headquartered in Hong Kong include Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse.Annual rents for office space jumped 51 percent in 2010 from the year before, and high demand and limited supply is expected to push up rents by a further 15 to 20 percent this year.",11:39.0

117,Greenberg: Momentum King’s Next Big Move,2011-03-30T20:25:57+0000,Herb Greenberg,"Over the years, when the market has gotten really wacky, tense and emotional, I have tended to always check in with the king of momentum investing: William O’Neil — or at least his organization, which includes Investors Business Daily. I’ve actually never talked to O’Neil, but I’ve often been surprised to hear they were long gone from (or certainly cautious on) some of the biggest momentum names when the market — or at least a cluster of names — has appeared to have gotten out of control. That’s when companies go from being just companies to being stocks. With that in mind, what’s the current state of momentum? Depends when you ask. “The first thing we always look at is the direction of the market, and it’s unclear at this point.” Chris Gessel, executive editor of IBD, has worked with O’Neil for 15 years and serves as the front man to people like me. We were talking late Tuesday morning — and at that point he was saying: Enter later in the afternoon, after the market closed. I checked back with Gessel and (surprise!) he had an update – proving just how unpredictable this market has become: “We’re changing our outlook back to an uptrend because of the action of the leaders,” he said. Does that mean the choppy and unclear nature of the market — with indexes in conflict with the leaders — is moot? “It’s not entirely resolved” Gessel said. “But the leaders are acting very well and the market is okay. Today’s positive reversal and close right near the high after last week’s positive action is getting hard to ignore.” What about the hottest stocks? Some of the big movers like Netflix, OpenTable, Chipotle and Apple are at points where Gessel says the O’Neil model might not commit new money “at this point.” (It tends to wait for the stock to start moving again with confirming volume.) ""The big easier gains have passed and a lot more diligence and disciplined trading is required. You need to buy at the right point."" On the other hand, AthenaHealthis starting to show up on the O’Neil radar, thanks to accelerating sales and earnings. “It’s a fairly new stock for us,” Gessel says. “But it had been going sideways for four years.” Even though it’s nearly double its summer lows, Gesssel says, “You wouldn’t look at this and call this a momentum stock.” Not yet, at least.

Growth stocks tend to be more exaggerated in their ties to the market. If the market is down 10%, they’ll be down 20% and 30%. (And vice-versa.) This is a very news-driven market, but even that statement is confusing. “In a strong bull market, no matter what the news, the market goes higher.” Yet in the world of O’Neil, the market is in an intermediate correction. “Historically, you would expect to see choppy sideways action, and that’s what we’re getting.” The indexes are not looking well – certainly not as good as the leading stocks. “Either the market has to catch up or the stocks have to give up gains.” Looming earnings adds another dimension of uncertainty. “If the market were much stronger, you wouldn’t have to worry about earnings, but we have the mixed message of the market indexes and leading stocks. You don’t see leading stocks run for prolonged periods without the market supporting them.” Enter later in the afternoon, after the market closed.

Still, that extra 0.18 or so percent would have been a small  price to pay for avoiding energy over the past year, as the  sector has lost a third of its value.  When there is a ""pronounced discrepancy in attractiveness,"" such  as the clear unattractiveness of energy at the beginning of the  year given dismal earnings expectations and high valuations, ""it  would seem logical to exclude that sector,"" S&P Capital IQ's equity chief investment officer, Erin Gibbs, wrote to CNBC.    ""However, these clear-cut unattractive sector events do not  happen that often, and therefore these products could have  limited appeal,"" she added.  Yet on the bright side, ""the risk of making a really bad bet  isn't as large as compared to, say, I simply took a narrow short  position in that sector compared to nothing else,"" Hyman said.  ""Simply excluding a sector is an opportunity to perhaps make some  reasonable outperformance without betting the farm.""  And for those who are already overexposed to a given sector,  finding a way to invest in most of the market while increasing  diversification does indeed seem prudent, even if it means a  slightly higher expense ratio.Read More  Bummer: Stocks badly missing strategists' mark",11:39.5
119,What to Expect From Apple: Analyst,2013-04-09T21:52:09+0000,Bruno J. Navarro,"For its stock to perform once again, Apple needs to provide investors with some level of  confidence in its future, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said  Tuesday.

On CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" Piecyk  issued a ""buy"" rating for Apple on March 14 with a price target  of $540 per share.

""I think the problem with Apple right now is people are just  questioning whether they can ever return to growth, whether they  had a peak earnings year last year that they'll never get back  to. If you can just return some level of confidence that they can  return to growth, then the stock will do very well, very  quickly.""  Piecyk took a balanced view of Apple's performance.

Mike Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, estimated $150 billion to $250 billion of losses based on $1.2 trillion of U.S. subprime loans, and an additional $150 billion of losses on derivatives linked to subprime debt. David Hilder, a Bear Stearns analyst, also estimated a $150 billion to $250 billion loss on subprime home loans, in what he called a $2 trillion market.

The package, of up to $80 million, will support the 51.75-megawatt (MW) Arbour Wind Farm in the south of the country. The facility is being built by the Abour Energy Company, a joint venture between Xenel International and AMEA Power.   A development institution that focuses on the private sector in emerging markets, the IFC is a sister organization of the World Bank and a member of the World Bank Group.   To date, it has invested over $300 million in Jordan to support clean energy.

""Jordan's energy sector has been on a steady path of reform,"" Mouayed Makhlouf, the IFC's director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement Tuesday. ""Supporting renewable energy projects and opening the sector to private investments is a pillar of our work in Jordan and the region,"" Makhlouf added.

Most of JPMorgan's revenue, some $6.9 billion, was accrued on its  home turf but the $3.9 billion generated in its Europe, Middle  East and Africa (EMEA) operations was enough to dislodge Deutsche  from the top place in that region.  In the same period last year, Deutsche was number one in EMEA  with revenue of $4.3 billion.

127,Energy Falls Despite 'Above Average' Hurricane Forecast,2011-05-19T17:45:37+0000,Sharon Epperson,"The federal government’s main weather forecasting agency warns of an “above average” hurricane season this summer.Yet, the energy market yawns.","cnbc, Articles, Business News, Energy, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","The federal government’s main weather forecasting agency warns of an “above average” hurricane season this summer.Yet, the energy market yawns.That's because the pre-season hurricane forecasts are too early, too broad and do not indicate where a storm will actually hit, according to traders.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration dialed back its Atlantic hurricane season forecast a little from last year. NOAA is predicting there will be 12 to 18 named storms, and six to 10 hurricanes. Three to six of those will be major hurricanes — Category 3, 4 or 5 — with winds of 111 miles per hour or more. The Atlantic hurricane season typically lasts from June 1 to November 30.NOAA is predicting this season we’ll see one less storm than last year. But so did Colorado State University in their 2011 forecast that was released in the beginning of April. CSU predicted the 2011 Atlantic Hurricane season would see 16 named storms, including five major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). So NOAA’s forecast wasn’t much different.Energy traders also point out that while there were five major hurricanes — in line with NOAA’s range of forecasts — none of them made landfall near any key U.S. oil or gas facilities. But that’s not the only reason this year’s NOAA forecast hasn’t had any immediate impact on energy prices today.NOAA's pre-season hurricane forecasts are much broader than the closely watched outlook's from Colorado State University and some private forecasters. As a result, these hurricane forecasts have a greater chance of making their mark. Last May, NOAA forecast there would be a 70 percent chance that we'd have between 14 and 23 named storms and  three to seven would be major hurricanes. That's a huge range. It’s hard to miss that. The season ended with a total of 19 named storms and five reached hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.The real impact, of course, comes when a storm or hurricane makes landfall in a major metro area or near a key refinery complex. Last year was the third most active on record and no storm made landfall on the continental U.S. Unlike some private forecasters, NOAA does not issue forecasts on how many storms will make landfall or where they could make landfall in its pre-season outlook.So what more do traders know today about this year’s hurricane season than they did yesterday? Not much.Slideshow: Scenes from the 2011 Floods",11:40.6
128,Banking stem cells in the hope of a lifesaving cure ,2013-07-28T11:00:00+0000,Dan Mangan,"Forget about cash—start banking your body.

Given the rate of developments in stem-cell research and their  potential for curbing health costs, Choulika thinks  Scéil's model of creating and storing stem cells one day  will become so cheap that it will become mandatory for people  with medical insurance.

Because of the accumulation of mutations in a person's DNA, the earlier a deposit in a stem-cell bank is made, the better, though ""it's never too late,"" Choulika  said.  The technology that Scéil uses is based on research that  won Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka the 2012 Nobel Prize for  Medicine.  (Read more: High medical bills drive bankruptcy)  For years, scientists believed that embryonic stem cells—the  cells that can generate all the types of cells in a person's  body—could be obtained only from embryos or blood in the  umbilical cord. That meant that unless umbilical blood was  collected at birth, there was no way to use existing cells to  cultivate new ones that later technologies might be able to grow  into full organs, blood or bones.  ""That was the paradigm,"" Choulika said. ""You could  never go back to the stage of stemness, like an embryonic cell,  the first stage of life,"" ""The stem cell, from the beginning of  life, gives you any kind of tissue. However, you can never go back  from there. ... Once you have a skin cell, the skin cell remains  a skin cell.""  But Yamanaka shattered that paradigm when he discovered in 2006  that ""intact mature cells in mice could be reprogrammed to become  immature stem cells"" when a cocktail of several genes were introduced into the mature cells, the Nobel Committee noted in  announcing the award last year.""With any cell of a person, then, you can rebuild any kind of  tissue,"" Choulika said. ""You can rebuild neurons; you can rebuild  blood. You can rebuild anything.""At the moment, the technology of building tissue on a large  scale is in its infancy, and years away from being able to grow  so-called pluripotent stem cells into full organs for transplant  into their donors.  Movement toward that goal was seen earlier this month, when the Japanese government approved the world's first clinical  trials using such stem cells for treating age-related  blindness. That conjures images of  the 1982 dystopian cult classic ""Blade  Runner,"" in which a memorable scene involves a scientist  working in a lab where human eyes are grown.  The cultivated stem cells also could be used to test drugs' efficacy and risks.—By CNBC's Dan Mangan. Follow him on  Twitter @_DanMangan.",11:40.6

But not just any Hispanic voters: Puerto Rican voters.The former vice president delivered his speech at a Hispanic Heritage month celebration in Kissimmee. While there were no crowds, the location reflected his campaign's effort to court Puerto Rican voters. Kissimmee is the seat of Osceola County, the only county in America where Puerto Ricans outnumber all other ancestral groups. Before he took the stage, Biden was introduced by two world-famous Puerto Rican performers, Ricky Martin and Luis Fonsi, and by Hispanic American actress and activist Eva Longoria. In prepared remarks, the former vice president ripped Trump's approach to the U.S. territory. ""Even after being president for four years, Donald Trump does not seem to grasp that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens already,"" he said.""I'm running to be president of all Americans, including 3 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico. I'm not going to steal the money that is desperately needed to reconstruct the island, in order to build a wall that does nothing to keep Americans safe. I'm not going to suggest that we sell or trade Puerto Rico. I'm not going to throw paper towels whose lives have been devastated by the hurricane,"" said Biden. Last fall, Trump shifted $300 million away from cash-strapped disaster relief agencies to fund border security projects, including his ""wall"" project on the southern border. In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, Trump allegedly wondered aloud whether the United States could ""sell"" the island or ""divest"" from it. And during a rare visit to Puerto Rico shortly after the hurricanes, Trump tossed rolls of paper towels into a crowd of survivors at a relief center. Biden also said Tuesday that while he personally supports adding Puerto Rico as a state, he will work with both sides of what is a bitter debate on the island, and let voters there ultimately decide their course. Along with Biden's visit, the campaign released a multi-pronged plan Tuesday afternoon to help rebuild and revitalize Puerto Rico, which is home to 3 million American citizens. Two devastating hurricanes in 2017 left millions of Puerto Ricans without power for months, prompting more than one hundred thousand to move to the mainland.Today, Florida is home to more than a million people who identify as Puerto Rican. Nationwide, Puerto Ricans represent the second largest pool of Hispanic voters in the country, after Mexican Americans. In Florida, more than one in four Latino voters identifies as Puerto Rican. Key elements of Biden's Puerto Rico plan: - Provide direct federal investment in infrastructure projects and forgive federal disaster aid - Offer Puerto Ricans more access to community-based health care and SNAP food assistance - Ease Puerto Rico's massive debt burden by reversing austerity measures and restructuring some of the debtIn a statement accompanying the new plan, the Biden campaign criticized Trump's response to the 2017 hurricanes in Puerto Rico. They also brought up the account of Elaine Duke, a former top official at the Department of Homeland Security. Earlier this year Duke told The New York Times that in the aftermath of the Hurricane Maria, Trump mused about whether the United States could sell Puerto Rico.Taken together, Biden's plan for Puerto Rico and his direct appeal on Tuesday to Puerto Rican voters represent the best example so far of what the Biden campaign says is an ultra-targeted strategy with Hispanic voters. In response to the concerns raised by the NBC poll last week, Biden campaign aides over the weekend emphasized that their outreach to Hispanic voters has expanded dramatically in recent weeks, and now includes full-time Hispanic-focused mobilization efforts in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada and Texas.""The pathway to victory includes winning key battleground states and we're going to do that by building a culturally competent campaign that targets states with heavy Hispanic populations,"" senior political adviser Jorge Neri said on a conference call with reporters Sunday.Biden aides also stressed how carefully targeted their Spanish language outreach is, up to and including using different Spanish accents in multiple versions of each campaign ad, accents that are tailored to the geographic origins of the Hispanic population in different markets.Below is one of the Spanish language ads Biden launched over the weekend.Currently, Biden ads appearing in the Miami and Tampa media markets are voiced with Cuban-accented Spanish. In and around Orlando, voters hear a Puerto Rican accent. And in West Palm, Fort Myers, and across Arizona, the narrator has a Mexican accent.""That is indispensable because we know that our communities, we share a language, but we have a tremendous diversity of experiences and from those experiences we have similar priorities, but we also have many unique interests,"" Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez told reporters. It's impossible to tell at this stage whether Biden's play for Puerto Rican voters will bear fruit. But already this week there are signs that perhaps the NBC/Marist poll was merely an outlier, and that Biden is actually doing better with Latino voters in Florida than it seemed he was last week.On Tuesday, Monmouth University released a new poll of Florida that showed Biden winning Latino voters 58 to 32 over Trump, a number that's much closer to Clinton's 2016 margin.",11:41.1

132,Maui Close to Averaging $4 for Gas,2008-03-14T09:54:35+0000,,"""Maui No Kai Oi"" is a popular Hawaiian saying that means Maui is the best. Mike Sweeney recently moved to this idyllic island from Denver and was hit with the other side of living in paradise with his first visit to the gas pump: Maui is also No. 1 in gas prices.","cnbc, Articles, Tesoro Corp, Chevron Corp, Business News, Energy, Oil and Gas, source:tagname:The Associated Press","""Maui No Kai Oi"" is a popular Hawaiian saying that means Maui is the best. Mike Sweeney recently moved to this idyllic island from Denver and was hit with the other side of living in paradise with his first visit to the gas pump: Maui is also No. 1 in gas prices. ""After seeing the total, I won't be smiling,"" Sweeney said as he watched the numbers on the Chevron pump spin faster than a slot machine. The pump finally stopped at $97.20, which put 24.5 gallons in his Chevrolet Avalanche. He was elated about living on Maui and being reunited with his black, super-size pickup truck, which just arrived from Colorado, but he wasn't so thrilled about paying nearly $4 for a gallon of regular. While the price of oil climbs above $110 a barrel, most Americans dread the day they will have to pay $4. On this tropical island and a few stations in California, $4 gas has already arrived, straining the pocketbooks of residents and businesses. Maui is on the verge of becoming first area in the nation to average $4 for a gallon of regular. The average price in Wailuku reached $3.934 on Thursday, the highest price in AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge Report. At several stations, it was a penny shy of $4. In the remote coastal town of Hana, it was around $4.40 a gallon. ""Outrageous. Completely outrageous,"" said Janet Carone, of Wailuku. The high price to get around has hurt many families, like the Carones. They're coping by driving less, carpooling or working more. ""It has a big effect because our housing is high, our food is high, and the gas prices just make it worse,"" she said. Other than AAA, perhaps no one on Maui tracks local gas prices better than Deok Lee, owner of Airport Taxi. He maintains a detailed record of gas expenses using Excel spreadsheets on his laptop. In just nine days, Lee had spent $300 to fuel his Toyota Sienna van. Like his drivers, the more Lee pays for gas, the less money he brings home. His pay shrinks by the day -- and by the gallon. ""Crazy,"" he said about the prices. ""Ridiculous."" Fuel cost has more than tripled since he took over the business in 1999, and it's forcing him to consider trading his van, which costs $80 to fill, for a smaller four-cylinder car. ""Unfortunately, it's going to take away some comfort for the customers. But you gotta do what you gotta do,"" he said. Lee expects many cabbies will be forced out of business if fuel prices keep rising. Chuck Gamarata, who operates the only limousine taxi on the island, is forced to work longer hours to compensate for the gas prices. He's still taking home about $10 less each day. ""You add that up over a year's period, that's thousands of dollars,"" he said. ""It hurts. It hurts bad."" Other businesses are also feeling pinched. Todd Winn, co-owner of North Shore Explorers, has been hit hard since launching the tour company in September. It takes 150 gallons of diesel, at $4.20 a gallon, to fill up his 30-foot rigid hull inflatable boat, which gets about a mile per gallon. It also costs more than $100 to fill up the Ford F-350 to tow it. While the new company is trying to build up clientele, it may be forced to raise rates or add a fuel surcharge. ""It's been dramatic enough that we've actually seen our original business model blown out the window,"" Winn said. ""It's been quite costly and we've had to cut costs in other areas to make it work."" He shakes his head when hearing about people in other states complaining about gas prices. Maui residents remember the good ol' days of $3 gas. ""It's just the price of living here,"" Winn said. ""I'm not sure it's fair. But at the same time, it's not going to get me to move back to the mainland to pay a buck less for a gallon of gasoline."" Hawaii is the most oil-dependent state in the nation, with more than 90 percent of its energy coming from imported oil. The state's economy is also extremely sensitive to oil prices globally because it depends on airplanes and ships to bring in tourists and all of its goods. Marie Montgomery, spokeswoman for AAA Hawaii, said it's a little comfort for islanders that gas prices haven't risen as fast as in other states, such as California. On Thursday, California hit another record with an average of $3.609, overtaking Hawaii ($3.587) for the nation's highest gas prices. Meanwhile, the national average has risen to a record $3.267, according to the auto club. But Maui, which doesn't have a major public transportation system, now has all the California cities beat by at least a quarter a gallon. Residents here have long wondered why gas prices on the island are so much higher than on neighboring Oahu, where Honolulu gas is about 50 cents less. ""It's like we work just to pay gas,"" resident Yolanda Ellis said. ""Funny how our gas goes up but our pay stays the same."" Hawaii, which imports most of its crude oil from Alaska and Indonesia, has two refineries on Oahu operated by Chevron  and Tesoro Hawaii . Both companies blame the Maui price on higher transportation costs, even though islands further away, such as the Big Island, have lower prices. They also cite several other factors, such as volume, competition and higher local taxes on Maui. Chevron spokesman Albert Chee said the price, in most cases, is set by the station operators and owners. The company sets the retail prices for only six stations it owns out of the 63 Chevron-branded outlets in Hawaii. The company wouldn't disclose the difference in wholesale price between Maui and Oahu. However, Chee said: ""It's not 50 cents. It's not even half."" ""The difference between Oahu and Maui of 50 cents is not flowing into my pocket,"" he said. Chevron noted that the cost of crude oil has spiked 20 percent in the past 30 days, while gasoline has increased 9 percent nationwide and only 5 percent in Hawaii. Not everyone seemed upset with the pump prices on Maui. Tourists, who pay an average close to $300 a night for a hotel room, don't seem to mind. ""If the gas would've been higher, we still would've gone,"" said Jack Glisson, of Jacksonville, Ill. ""It didn't make any difference.""",11:41.3

The home appliances maker surged close to the top of the European benchmark after posting stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results and forecast easing cost headwinds over the coming months. Shares of the company were up over 10 percent.Europe's banking index led the losses amid earnings news. Deutsche Bank reported its first full-year net profit in four years on Friday. However, shares came under pressure, losing 0.59 percent as Germany's largest lender continues to face growing merger speculation and a series of uphill struggles.Germany's Wirecard, meanwhile, plummeted 25 percent after a Financial Times report said an external firm commissioned by the payments firm to investigate its Singapore office found evidence indicating ""serious offences or forgery and/or of falsification of accounts."" Wirecard called the report ""inaccurate, misleading and defamatory.""On the data front, euro zone inflation slipped as expected last month.

Here's CNBC's collection of  Europe's top ten upcoming risk events, according to analysts.Greece's economic crisis reached a peak in the summer of 2015  when it was forced, by impending bankruptcy, to accept a third 86  billion euro ($96.9 billion) bailout package from international  lenders.  A year on and Greece is facing an uphill struggle to meet the  conditions of its latest bailout. ""The economic and political  challenges across southern Europe continue to increase,""  according to Eurasia Group's Rahman. (103880026) ""While Greece  will of course struggle, the debate between (main political  party) Syriza and its creditors is no different to the one that  took place last year. As such, Greece is in something of a  Groundhog Day.""Spain's economy might be booming compared to its euro zone peers  (it expanded more than Germany, France and Italy in the second  quarter of this year). However, an ongoing political impasse in  the country threatens to derail that growth, with the country  potentially facing a third general election in 12 months by the  end of the year.  ""A third round of elections remains the most probable scenario  (55 percent probability),"" according to Antonio Barroso, deputy  director of research at political risk consultancy Teneo  Intelligence. ""Short of an internal revolt within the PSOE  (Socialist party) or a deal between the ruling People's Party  (PP) and Basque nationalists (which would allow a government to  be formed).""Aside from national political deadlock in Spain, the question of  Catalonia's independence movement rumbles on. The separatist  movement in the wealthy north Spanish state has long been a thorn  in the side of Madrid and that clash is set to continue, Teneo's  Barroso warned.  ""Catalan authorities will likely approve again further measures  to advance towards the creation of an independent state, which  will promptly be challenged legally by Madrid. Therefore, the  clash between Madrid and the Catalan authorities is likely to  intensify in the coming months,"" he said.Italy's banking system seems to have avoided going into meltdown  this summer despite fears over the estimated 360 billion euros  worth of non-performing loans on its banks' books. But it's the  country's political system that is now at risk with Prime  Minister Matteo Renzi facing a referendum on reforms in October  which, if he loses, could see him resign. This would leave the  country in limbo in terms of leadership and economic reforms  which Eurasia Group said had ""lost momentum"" ahead of the  referendum.   ""For now, we continue to believe the referendum will pass (with  60 percent confidence). But this means there's a non-negligible  risk it will not. In this case, the government would collapse,  despite Renzi's recent protestations to the contrary, paving the  way for an ineffectual caretaker government,"" Eurasia Group said.As Eurasia Group said in its note Thursday, ""political mess in  Athens, Lisbon, Madrid and Rome carry implications for Berlin and  Frankfurt."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel – seen widely as  the euro zone's strongest leader -- can ill-afford problems in  the rest of the single currency area given her own increasingly  fragile grip on power.   Her handling of the region's refugee crisis (in sum, allowing  over 1 million migrants into Germany in 2015 alone) has prompted  a drop in her approval ratings, criticism from rivals both within  Germany and the wider EU. Her own party, the Christian Democratic  Union, has been pummeled in local and state elections, leading to  questions over whether Merkel can stand for election again in  2017.Like most of Europe, far-right parties (like the National Front  in France or Pegida in Germany) have been gaining a foothold in  the political scene, worrying the mainstream political  establishment. Austria is no exception, Eurasia Group noted,  stating that a presidential election on October 2 looked certain  to ""hand power to the EU's first far-right head of state -  (Norbert Hofer).""   ""While his powers as president would be limited, Hofer will use  every opportunity to facilitate a victory for his party in 2018  or before, if any crisis (refugees, euro zone) gives him an  excuse to dismiss the government. As Austria's main  representative abroad, Hofer will seek to strengthen ties with  central eastern European governments which are most critical of  Brussels and Berlin. That would represent a particular challenge  for Merkel,"" the group noted.Europe's migrant crisis has exposed challenges in the region not  only in terms of its ability to respond to a humanitarian crisis  but also its political cohesion and ambitions. Overwhelmed by the  influx of desperate migrants,  the EU struck a deal with  Turkey that would see it preventing migrants from reaching the  continent, in return for money, visa liberalization for Turkish  citizens visiting the EU and fast-tracked EU membership.  That deal was struck before Turkish President Recep Tayyip  Erdogan led a crackdown on the opposition following a failed coup  attempt, putting him at odds with EU values on freedom of speech  and the rule of law, leading the EU to delay its part of the deal  (in terms of visa liberalization). Eurasia Group noted that ""in  the aftermath of the failed coup attempt in Turkey, risks to the  EU-Turkey refugee deal have increased"" and although it thought  the deal would stick the analysis firm said this would depend on  Erdogan's reaction to the delayed visa liberalization.The EU's deal with Turkey has not been enough to assuage the  concerns of certain eastern European nations over migration to  the EU.  Hungary and its ruling, right-wing Fidesz  government has been one of the more vociferous opponents of the  EU's migrant policy response and it is holding a referendum on  October 2 on whether it should reject the EU's migrant quota  system (which would see the country have to accept a certain  quota of migrants).  ""Although the urgency of the refugee crisis has subsided, the  government' hard and effective campaign will boost turnout and  likely result in a rejection of the (European) Commission's  scheme … This result will strengthen Fidesz domestically and  cause more friction across Europe, since Hungary will now be  pushed to take an even more vocal stance against the commission's  current plans,"" Eurasia Group's team noted.Terrorism has yet to be mentioned in the long list of risks  facing Europe but France has had more than its fair share of  terrorism-related events in the last year. After the Paris  massacres last spring (on the Charlie Hebdo offices) and last  November to the recent Bastille Day attack in Nice, the country  has been forced to do some soul-searching over its policies  towards migrants, integration and assimilation – and the  government's response to the terrorism threat.  French President Francois Hollande's approval ratings are at a  low ebb (around 18 percent as of the last Ipsos Mori poll for Le  Point magazine in mid-August) and he has yet to say whether he  will run for the presidency in elections in 2017.  The  dwindling of Hollande's authority – and resignation of Economy  Minister Emmanuel Macron - has left the future of economic  reforms in doubt.  Since Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the alleged support for  a pro-Russian uprising in Ukraine, the country has been on a  collision course with its European neighbors with reciprocal  sanctions now in place between the two bodies.  Despite its economic isolation, however, Russia has seen  something of a resurgence on the global stage recently,  particularly as a key part of the Western alliance fighting  Islamic State in Syria – leaving the EU out in the cold,  according to Marc Pierini from think tank Carnegie Europe.  ""The Syrian war has left the EU in a second-tier position among  international actors,"" Pierini said in a note last month. ""The  EU's internal divisions have given the union little influence on  the course of events in Syria. Yet the brunt of the war's  humanitarian, economic, and security consequences falls on EU  countries. The EU's future role in Syria will be a litmus test of  a genuine common foreign and security policy.""Against such a minefield of potential problems in Europe,  suddenly Britain's decision to leave the folds of the EU doesn't  look too bad – not least of all because nothing has actually  been done since the vote. Britain has yet to trigger the  now-legendary ""Article 50"" of the Lisbon Treaty which would set  in motion the formal process of leaving the EU, and could wait  until mid-2017 to do so.  Europe's institutions and leaders have expressed their  exasperation with the U.K. for its delay in starting the exit  process but given the other issues on its plate, Brexit could be  the least of its worries – especially if leaders like  Germany's Merkel, France's Hollande and Italy's Renzi are soon  faces of the past. As Eurasia Group concluded its note: ""While  Brexit is indeed serious, little or no substantive political risk  is likely from this through year-end. But Brexit's noise  seriously masks meaningful political and market risks in  Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria, Hungary and Turkey.""",11:41.7

That puts fourth-quarter revenue at about $915 million, short of analysts' estimates for $1.12 billion, according to Refinitiv data.The projected $165 million impact consists of a roughly $105 million dent from a lack of treadmills sales during the period, since all sales are halted, Peloton said. The company is also assuming about 10% of current treadmill owners will ask for a refund for their machines, which cost $4,300 apiece, and that would lower sales by an additional $50 million.Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey had expected the recall to have a larger impact.

For most riders the two-wheeler is the cheaper and more flexible alternative to a car but for a growing band of more affluent Indians owning a customised superbike has become the ultimate symbol of the country’s new-found wealth.,"cnbc, Articles, Harley-Davidson Inc, Business News, source:tagname:Financial Times","Every day India’s cities hum with the sound of hundreds of motorcycles precariously weaving their way through traffic. For most riders the two-wheeler is the cheaper and more flexible alternative to a car but for a growing band of more affluent Indians owning a customised superbike has become the ultimate symbol of the country’s new-found wealth.Sales of premium bikes made by the likes of Italy’s Ducati, Japan’s Suzuki and Harley-Davidson of the U.S. have grown steadily over the past few years after New Delhi in 2007 agreed to permit the import of bikes with a more than 800cc engine as long as they met certain emissions standards.Foreign brands say they are attracted by India’s rising income levels, growing demand for luxury goods and evidence of an organic motorcycle culture.Germany’s BMW recently started selling superbikes through two of its dealerships. And last month Triumph, the iconic British motorcycle manufacturer that collapsed in the 1980s and was later resuscitated by a property tycoon, said it would move into India. The group has tapped Ashish Joshi – the former European head of Royal Enfield, the British motorcycle marque that was revived by India’s Eicher Motors – to lead its Indian charge.Fans of the Rocket III and Daytona 675 have been urging Triumph to enter the Indian market for some time but the group says its focus has been on increasing sales at home and in developed markets such as the US and Italy.Triumph, which produces just 50,000 bikes a year, last year launched in Russia and says moving into India now is about “getting a toehold” in a market with lots of potential.Analysts say that while India’s broader bike market has seen double-digit growth over the past few years, the premium segment is still just a niche market.Foreign companies are required to pay hefty import taxes that in effect double the cost of the bikes, although some manufacturers have sought to reduce costs by assembling bikes in India. And with prices starting from $9,000-$20,000, they say performance bikes are still out of the reach of many middle-class professionals.“We have entered the Indian market at a time when leisure riding is at a nascent stage and feel we can shape that,” says Anoop Prakash, managing director for Harley-Davidson India. “I’m quite bullish. In 2010 the market for premium bikes stood at 1,000 units a year. My view is that the market could see a 10-fold increase over the next five to seven years in India.”Ducati, meanwhile, says it expects to double the number of bikes sold in India to 200 in the next 12 months.The units sold may be low but auto experts calculate that the high profit margins on each bike mean premium manufacturers are making money out of India. They often reap extra sales from merchandising or from customers who just want to soak up the super bike experience in cafés connected to the showrooms or at sponsored rock concerts.But analysts say foreign brands cannot expect a smooth ride. Mr Prakash says India’s regulatory environment is not always easy to predict. On the one hand the government was very “encouraging” about Harley’s initial investment. But he says the industry was surprised when the government decided to raise the duty on completed knocked down (CKD) kits for car and bike manufacturers, based on a revision of the definition of CKD in India, from 10 per cent to 60 per cent in the April Union Budget. The government settled on a 30 per cent rise but Mr Prakash says the move “caught everyone off guard”.Harley absorbed the rise in duty and remains committed to the market. But Mr Prakash says such moves “may give some of our peers pause for thought”",11:42.2

146,Three ways to jump-start job growth,2016-01-11T11:29:03-0500,,"The economy is off to a rocky start in 2016. Investors and analysts are unhappy. But while many analysts focus on jittery stock markets and bad news from overseas, there is a disheartening trend right before our eyes that almost no one is paying attention to: The high-growth, young companies that have traditionally driven job growth and innovation in our country are a dying breed. For the past several decades, business start-ups have steadily declined in America.    Have people become less ambitious? Less innovative? That's unlikely. A more probable explanation is that a steady accrual of rules and regulations for years has effectively eliminated a generation of entrepreneurs as the costs of running a new enterprise outweigh the benefits. The good news is that there is an antidote: increasing economic freedom.   But first, let's look at the scope of the problem.  New and young businesses have historically been the heart of the U.S. economy. They are responsible for nearly all the new jobs we produce each year. And yet a growing body of research shows that young businesses have been on the decline in the U.S. since the 1980s, which means we have far fewer jobs available today than if businesses were still starting at the 1980s rate.   Even more alarming:  The share of high-growth young companies has collapsed, a new National Bureau of Economic Research study reports. The authors show that, historically, most job growth among young businesses has come from a small percentage of them that are growing much faster than all the others. Since 1999, this fast-growing cohort has essentially vanished, and young businesses are now more likely to be characterized as no-growth or slow-growth.  In other words, the dynamism most of us associate with the U.S. economy's ability to create jobs and foster innovation through new enterprises is evaporating before our eyes.   Imagine if a steady stream of research showed an alarming spike in life-threatening diseases caused by additives in our food that had been weakening our immune systems. We would be doing everything we could as a society to understand and remove these debilitating additives from our food.  Despite a growing body of evidence that declining entrepreneurial dynamism is weakening our economy, policy makers have done little to understand the ""additives"" in our economy that are creating the problem. For help, they might start with the Fraser Institute's annual Economic Freedom of North America report.  The latest report finds that states with more stringent labor laws, business start-up costs, licensing laws, and compliance costs — to name a few —  perform worse than more economically free states. Per capita income in the most free states is 14 percent higher than in the most un-free states.   Undaunted, however, regulators continue to pump harmful additives into our economy. Regulations implemented over the past seven years alone amount to a $100 billion tax on the economy. One estimate finds that 31 percent of regulations increase compliance costs without providing any real health or safety benefit.  The well-documented explosion in state licensing laws over the past generation has kept an untold number of entrepreneurs from entering the marketplace in the first place. It is no wonder that small business owners now rank regulations on par with taxes as the single biggest threat to their growth, more than the cost of health insurance or competition with big businesses.  Policy makers should pursue three courses of action to liberate would-be entrepreneurs from the tangled web of rules that hold them back. First, Congress should enact legislation requiring congressional approval of all federal regulations estimated to have an impact above a certain dollar amount, such as $100 million. Congress' bad habit of delegating rule-making authority to unelected officials in federal agencies is a big reason we have had an explosion in costly, complicated rules.  Second, Congress should enact a cap on the number and dollar amount of regulatory requirements every year. There are several ways to do this such as eliminating old regulations for each new, proposed regulation or capping the overall cost of regulations each year. Canada recently passed legislation capping their annual regulatory activity. The United States should do the same.  Third, state-level policy makers should provide alternatives to professional licensing, such as allowing individuals to opt out of licensing requirements in favor of nationally recognized, self-certification registries that rely on the tools of accountability and trust at the heart of the sharing economy. Too many professions have begun behaving like cartels behind the guise of licensing requirements. It is past time to break them up.  We hear a lot in our public discourse about inequality, but we hear far too little about our declining entrepreneurial dynamism. What if the latter is driving the former? It is certainly clear that starting a new business is not the path to upward mobility that it once was for middle class families.   The trend of declining business start-ups has worsened to the point that our children may never know the range of opportunity Americans, until recently, took for granted. It is time for our policy makers to follow the data and embrace economic freedom over the rules and regulations that are discouraging would-be entrepreneurs from getting in the game.

Entrepreneurs—both established and aspiring—are  eager to capitalize on this interest. But opening your own  bakery, clothing boutique or furniture store can be a daunting task  without the passion and perseverance to weather the ups and  downs.Being prepared well before opening the doors to your  brick-and-mortar store can help you avoid some potential  pitfalls. Here are five  steps that can help you start out strong. Just because an area of town or a local strip mall has  significant foot traffic doesn't necessarily mean it is the right  location for the type of customer you'll want.  ""It's all about location, location, location,"" said Melinda  Emerson, founder of  SucceedAsYourOwnBoss.com. Before getting locked  into a standard five- to 10-year lease, ""you want to understand  where the foot traffic is coming from,"" she said. Read MoreRise in freelancers a boon to  entrepreneurs Knowing who your buyers are and identifying a target  audience will help in finding the best location for your  store. Emerson's suggestion: Test your idea with  a ""pop-up"" location, which allows you to rent short-term  space. The online start-up Storefront, for example, connects store owners and  landlords with retail spaces in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles  and San Francisco for $150 to $1,500 a day.Developing a three-year business plan can help you (and potential  lenders) know what costs to expect. Go to the U.S. Small Business  Administration website or talk to a counselor at a local Small  Business Development Center for free help in writing your  plan.   ""Identify available capital and set a budget,"" recommends Nicole  Leinbach Reyhle, founder of the online publication Retail Minded.  Allocate some money to cover any  surprise expenses, but make sure you cover the  basics too. Consider how much money you'll need to rent or lease  the location as well as the cost of inventory, staff,  merchandising and display fixtures, a computer or point-of-sale  provider, and marketing and advertising.First, be prepared to put a good chunk of your  own money in your business. Lenders want to see that you're  willing to bank on your store before they do. Next, contact  friends and family. If they've invested, you may be more  reluctant to lose their money than your own. Getting a bank loan  can be tough since many lenders won't loan money to small  start-ups with no track record. But there are other  options. Read MoreWave of 'accidental' entrepreneurs on the rise Talk to other businesses that have been successful using  peer-to-peer lenders, such as crowdfunding platforms, where  people lend money to a business and get paid back over the course  of the loan. A $5,000 or $10,000 loan can make a big difference  for a small business, said Jill Johnson, founder and CEO of the  Institute for Entrepreneurial Leadership (IFEL) in Newark, New Jersey.  ""It may allow you to do a pilot or get a piece of equipment to  operate more efficiently.""A big chunk of the budget of a new store often goes to marketing  and advertising to get those first customers in the door. ""Social  media is extremely valuable,"" and much less expensive than  traditional advertising, Reyhle says. Check out some of the free  marketing resources at ShopSmall.com, a website from American Express to  help independent retailers promote their businesses.  A few more tips: ""Word of mouth far outweighs any media you  can buy. Think of three things that you do that your competitors  don't do and put that on your business card and website,"" said  Marc Wilson, a retail consultant with the Virginia Small Business  Development Center network. Put effort into making sure your  business secures search traffic too. ""Make sure your business is  the first listing that comes up when some searches for it on  Google.""""Having a support team in place is so important,"" said  IFEL's Johnson. ""Too often entrepreneurs are making decisions in  a vacuum. You need people with real expertise who will give you  honest feedback.""

148,"Biden's national polling lead shrinks slightly, but swing states show signs of trouble for Trump",2020-09-17T15:57:50+0000,Kevin Breuninger,"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is still leading President Donald Trump in the polls, though averages of national surveys show a trend toward a slightly tightening race with less than seven weeks until Election Day. But Biden continues to hold his edge over the incumbent in a handful of crucial swing states, including some that Trump won in 2016.Individual polls of the race for the White House show a much wider variance. National surveys released this week from The Economist/YouGov and Reuters/Ipsos both put Biden up 9 points on Trump among likely voters.

That spread has shrunk from the 7.2-point lead RCP displayed for Biden just two weeks earlier. FiveThirtyEight's own polling tracker, which on Sept. 3 had Biden 7.3 points above Trump, now gives the Democratic challenger a 6.7-point advantage.Individual polls of the race for the White House show a much wider variance. National surveys released this week from The Economist/YouGov and Reuters/Ipsos both put Biden up 9 points on Trump among likely voters. But Rasmussen — the president's favorite pollster, which has consistently found higher levels of support for him than other outfits — on Wednesday gave Trump his first-ever polling lead over Biden, by 1 point, which falls within its margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.But national polls are only part of the story, as any number of anxious Democratic voters will be quick to point out. In 2016, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton trounced Trump in the popular vote by more than 2.8 million votes, but still lost the Electoral College.That race came down to a series of upset victories by Trump in key swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. Trump walked away with 306 electoral votes to Clinton's 232.RCP's swing-state tracker, however, shows Biden leading to varying degrees in all of those battleground states, as well as in North Carolina and Arizona, which Trump also won in 2016.That polling tracker now gives Biden an overall spread of 3.7 points over Trump — a wider lead than it showed at the start of the month.That shift appears to be driven by recent surveys of voters in Wisconsin and Arizona, both of which show Biden furthering his gains over Trump since the end of August.In Arizona, RCP shows Biden with a 4.7-point lead over Trump, who in 2016 beat Clinton in the Grand Canyon State by about 3.5 percentage points.The Trump campaign appears to be taking notice, announcing Thursday that it would air a new ad, featuring a business owner praising the president and attacking Biden's record, specifically in Arizona.Still, the race in Arizona remains tight, according to a survey of the state released Thursday morning by the Monmouth University Polling Institute. While Biden in that poll holds a 4-point lead among all registered voters in the state, 48%-44%, the gap shrinks to just 2 percentage points under a model of likely voters with high turnout, with Biden at 48% and Trump at 46%. In a low-turnout model, Monmouth finds Trump and Biden tied at 47% among likely voters.Monmouth surveyed 420 registered voters in Arizona by phone between Friday and Tuesday. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.Cook Political Report, meanwhile, moved Arizona's election rating from ""Toss Up"" to ""Lean Democrat"" earlier Thursday morning, citing in part Biden's support among Latinos in the state. The same can't be said for Florida, where recent polls showed Biden underperforming among Latinos.The Biden campaign has reacted quickly. The former vice president himself visited South Florida on Tuesday, and his campaign over the weekend announced new ads in the state targeting different groups of Hispanic voters.The shifting polls come as the economy, health care and the coronavirus pandemic take center stage in the campaign messaging for both Trump and Biden.More than 6.63 million Covid-19 cases and at least 196,831 deaths from the disease have been reported in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump, eager to recover the devastating economic losses from the pandemic before the election, has proclaimed that his administration has done a ""great job"" on the crisis and has repeatedly floated the possibility of a vaccine being developed and distributed before Election Day. His own health experts, however, have suggested the timeline would be much slower.Biden, meanwhile, describes the U.S. response as being tragically mishandled.The president in recent weeks has also weathered a series of potentially damaging news stories related to the coronavirus, including revelations from veteran journalist Bob Woodward that Trump admitted downplaying the dangers of the virus.The polling averages, however, don't reflect any dramatic change following these reports, offering further evidence for the view among political watchers that Trump's core base of support is simply unshakable.But that's a blessing and a curse, analyst Charlie Cook noted last week:""There is nothing that could be said or written, nothing that Trump can say or do, that would crack his base. Those expecting Trump to drop at the next negative story forget that it is hard to take a drop if you've never risen in the first place,"" Cook wrote.""But this is also why those who are convinced that he will make a spectacular comeback are likely to be wrong as well. His standing is impervious to events.""",11:43.1

151,Gold as Collateral: Could This Solve the Euro Crisis?,2012-11-05T06:36:34+0000,,"Debt-crippled euro zone countries could see the yields on their sovereign bonds fall dramatically if they used their gold reserves as collateral for that debt issuance, according to Sylvester Eijffinger, professor of financial economics at Tilburg University.","cnbc, Articles, Business News, Economy, Europe Economy, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Debt-crippled euro zone countries could see the yields on their sovereign bonds fall dramatically if they used their gold reserves as collateral for that debt issuance, according to Sylvester Eijffinger, professor of financial economics at Tilburg University.Funding costs have risen to unsustainable levels for several euro zone countries, forcing them to seek financial aid from their fellow euro partners.If governments were to use gold as collateral, sovereign credit risk would be reduced and the European Central Bank would no longer have to buy up debt from struggling euro zone members, Eijffinger told CNBC.The ECB's plan to buy unlimited amounts of short-dated government debt, known as Outright Monetary Transactions or OMT,  has been heavily criticized. Although the scheme eased investors' nerves, many analysts argue it will be equivalent to the ECB printing money to finance governments.Using gold as collateral would pose fewer risks to the ECB's balance sheet than the ECB's recently launched bond-buying program, Eijffinger said.Of all euro zone countries struggling with high debts, Portugal and Italy would benefit most from the method because they hold large reserves of gold. Spain, Ireland and Greece would not gain as much.Italy holds 2450 metric tons of gold, and Portugal has 383 metric tons of gold. This compares to Spain's 282 metric tons of gold, and Greece's 112 metric tons of gold, according to the World Gold Council.Italy holds gold reserves of 24 percent of its two-year funding requirements, for Portugal this is 30 percent, according to the World Gold Council. A recent EU study titled ""A More Effective Euro Area Monetary Policy than OMTs -Gold-Backed Sovereign Debt""  also recommended that the central banks of euro zone countries use gold as collateral for highly distressed bonds to allow the euro area to reduce financing costs, like it did in the past.The study, authored by Professor Ansgar Belke University from the Duisburg-Essen university in Germany shows that in the 1970s Italy and Portugal employed their gold reserves as collateralfor loans from Germany's Bundesbank, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and other institutions like the Swiss National Bank. ""Italy received a $2 billion bail-out from the Bundesbank in 1974 and put up its gold as collateral. More recently, in 1991, India applied its gold as collateral for a loan with the Bank of Japan and others. And in 2008, Sweden's Riksbank used its gold to raise some cash and provide additional liquidity to the Scandinavian banking system,"" the study said.""It would be more transparent, would not be inflationary and would foster reforms,"" the study said.RestrictionsThere are some restrictions to using gold as collateral however.Central banks of euro zone countries along with the Swedish Central Bank and the Swiss Central Bank signed a contract in 2009 which stated they would not put more than 400 tons of gold on the market over the course of the five years that followed.Since the euro zone was formed, all of the gold that euro zone member states hold has been pooled by the ECB. Member states' central banks are not allowed to make decisions over these holdings without getting approval from the ECB.""This may limit the options until 2014, but a country will only have to sell if [it defaulted on its debt]  they do not live up to all the conditions that are being set ,"" Eijffinger said. Dr. Moorad Choudhry, treasurer at RBS corporate banking, told CNBC that the option ""is not a solution to the euro zone's structural problems."" ""It would just be kicking the can down the road and wouldn't solve anything  in the long term,"" he said.""It holds troubled euro zone countries back from taking any critical decisions. The structural problems of these countries need urgent attention, and an ability to borrow cheaper than what they are paying now doesn't address these problems. As a technical option the idea  works, but  for more  emotional  reasons  it probably won't happen ,"" Choudhry said.The ECB declined the comment on the possibility of using gold as collateral.The euro area holds 10,792 tonnes of gold, which is about 6.5 percent of all gold that has ever been mined and worth some $590 billion, according to the European Parliament study. —By CNBC.com's Liza Jansen; Follow Her on Twitter @lizajansen",11:43.7

156,Here's how much the bull market helped savers,2016-04-28T20:26:47+0000,Susie Poppick,"The Standard & Poor's 500 Index has returned more than 200 percent since March  2009, the start of what's now the second-longest bull run in history.  Yet retirement savers and mom-and-pop investors haven't seen such big gains. While 401(k) plan balances have  bounced back since their lows seven years ago, most Americans  still fall woefully short of the savings they'll need to last  them through retirement.  Back in 2007, people in their 60s had average 401(k) balances of  about $120,000. That figure plunged to about $90,000 in early  2009, and climbed back to more than $150,000 by the end of 2015,  according to data from Fidelity. For most, that's still  significantly short of the recommended account balance for people  on the brink of retirement: Eight to ten times your final salary.  ""Frankly, if you have only about $100,000, you aren't going to be  able to retire,"" said Brooklyn, N.Y.-based financial planner Mark Sallinger.  ""While some expenses will wane, and you might no longer have kids  or a mortgage to pay for, health and medical costs are going  through the roof.""

Indeed, although Americans of all ages have seen their retirement  accounts recover since the financial crisis, average balances  suggest even younger people are behind on reaching the  recommended targets of one times salary by age 30 and three times  salary by age 40.  Figures from other sources look even lower: The average account  balance for 401(k) plans in 2009 was about $51,000 —  compared to about $76,000 in 2014, according to Department of  Labor data provided to CNBC by retirement plan research firm  Brightscope.  Now, most retirement savers don't invest exclusively in the S&P (nor should they, necessarily) and fees and contribution levels are an important part of the story when it comes to paltry retirement savings. But it's clear that the downturn set savers back.One problem is that many small investors tend to get fearful as  stocks fall, and sell — locking in losses. And as gains  return, missing just a couple good days of market performance can  actually wipe  out the majority of your returns.  ""Some individual investors got spooked in 2008 and sold low,"" Sallinger said. ""So not everyone has been able to partake in  the bull market. For the investors who are dipping a toe back in  now, it's late in the cycle.""  Even those investors who got back into stocks relatively early in  the bull run have trailed the index: The average investor in a  U.S. equity fund saw annualized returns of about 9 percent over  the last 5 years — a period during which the S&P 500  returned nearly 12 percent annualized, according to Morningstar  data. Investors often lag the very funds they hold because  of poorly-timed trading.  But the case that mom and pop missed out on the bull market  shouldn't be overstated, said Sean Collins, senior  director of industry and financial analysis at Investment Company  Institute, which represents the fund industry.  ""Money in 401(k)s and IRAs tends to be pretty steady coming in  month in and month out,"" Collins said. ""While there's no doubt  that investors do respond to returns, that response tends to be  pretty muted.""  More significant has been the trend of investors moving toward  global equity funds and domestic exchange traded fund, Collins said.While certain  companies have especially outperformed since the 2009 low —  like consumer discretionary stocks, up more than 400 percent  — the bull market has buoyed all sectors, said S&P Dow  Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt.  Unfortunately, that means it's getting harder to find bargains,  he said.""Overall we have come back well,"" Silverblatt said, ""but the  market looks expensive whether you're looking at P/E or price to  cash flow.""",11:44.3

The ""Halftime Report"" experts  and guest host, Rich Pzena, debated the potential merits--and pitfalls--of  tying CEO compensation to share price.   The desk is in agreement that such a policy can create negative  incentives for CEOs. Rather than focus on metrics like growth and  dividends, CEOs might instead exercise measures to artificially  inflate stock price. While a higher price in the short term would  benefit the individual, it might come at the expense of long term  growth.    ""I think it's well intentioned since there's been a tremendous  amount of money lost in the stock,"" Josh Brown said of the  burrito maker's plan.   But intention aside, Brown doesn't think it's a good idea. ""I'm  not sure it's so great because you set up a lot of perverse  incentives when you try to get mangers focused on stock price,""  he said.From a different standpoint, Steve Weiss believes such a  policy is also bad for the CEO since ""the one thing you can't  predict is the market and stock price."" While he believes that  there are very few ""bad actor"" CEOs out there who would  intentionally try to manipulate stock price, he thinks  compensation should be determined by ""operating metrics"" alone.

Since the election, the major indexes have surged; the , Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite have  gained over 5 percent, nearly 8 percent, and 4 percent in that  time, respectively. Analysts see several forces at work pushing  the markets to record highs in recent weeks.   ""This rally is tied to Trump's business-friendly campaign  promises of lower corporate taxes, less regulation and a bump in  infrastructure spending,"" Pat Keon of Thomson Reuters Lipper  wrote in a recent report on U.S. fund flow data.  What's more is that, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data,  last week marked the fourth straight week of net inflows for  equity ETFs.   Indeed, the prospect of infrastructure spending has Phillip  Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, bullish on  equities at these levels.   ""When you see infrastructure spending being promoted … you  also see tax cuts on businesses. … You're going to see that  expansion across the board here, and that flow of funds is going  to happen,"" Streible said Friday on ""Trading  Nation.""   Alas, these gains have come at the expense of the global bond  market, which in November saw record outflows.  ""So it was a reallocation of funds, and I wouldn't be surprised  if we see a continuation back to the upside,"" Streible  said.",11:45.1

164,Fitch Rates $202MM New York Local Government Assistance Corp. Bonds 'AA'; Outlook Stable ,2010-11-12T18:28:03+0000,,"NEW YORK, Nov 12, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings assigns an 'AA' rating
to the following New York Local Government Assistance Corporation (LGAC) bonds:

--$202,550,000 series 2010B refunding bonds (subordinate lien).The bonds are being issued for refunding purposes.In addition, Fitch affirms the 'AA' rating on approximately $3.4 billion of
outstanding LGAC senior and subordinate lien bonds, including the underlying
rating on the series 2003A-4V bonds for which liquidity is being substituted and
insurance removed.Fitch does not make a rating distinction between the senior and subordinate
liens due to the strong coverage and impoundment provisions.The Rating Outlook is Stable.RATING RATIONALE:

--The designated source of payment, a portion of the state sales tax, is
broad-based and provides generous coverage of debt service.--Although bond payments require annual legislative appropriation, there are
strong protective provisions for insufficient funding and non-appropriation.Fitch believes that these features effectively eliminate the risk of
non-appropriation.--The state's economy is broad, with substantial wealth and resources, although
the health of the state's economy and finances is closely linked to the cyclical
financial services industry.--Strong financial planning and reporting practices, including quarterly
financial plan updates, allow the state to stay abreast of changing conditions.This credit strength is offset by the state's historical tendency to rely on
nonrecurring measures rather than sustainable budget solutions to address
revenue weakening in downturns.--New York's debt burden is above average but still in the moderate range, and
pensions are well funded.KEY RATING DRIVERS:

--Changes in New York State's general obligation (GO) rating, to which this
rating is linked.--The state's GO rating will be driven by its continued ability to address
budget shortfalls and protect its cash position.---Further driving the state's rating would be any meaningful change to the
shape of the financial services industry, which would have significant
implications for the state's economy and finances.SECURITY:

LGAC's bonds are general obligations of the corporation, payable, subject to
annual state legislative appropriation, from the yield of one cent of the
four-cent state sales and use tax required by statute to be deposited in the
local government assistance tax fund.CREDIT SUMMARY:

The strength of the state's incentive to appropriate for the LGAC bonds results
in a rating equal to that assigned to New York's GO debt despite the
appropriation requirement for payment of debt service. In the event of
non-appropriation, the state would be unable to receive revenues held by the
LGAC tax fund, which receives one cent of the state's sales tax and contributes
more than $2 billion to the state general fund. Security strengths include the
broad sales tax base, the consistently high level of coverage (about 6.3 times
(x) maximum annual debt service based on fiscal 2010 revenues), and the
structural protections in place. Fitch does not make a rating distinction
between the senior and subordinate liens due to the strong impoundment
provisions and coverage.LGAC was created in 1990 as a means of financing $4.7 billion of the state's
accrued general fund deficit, replacing the annual spring borrowing for local
aid payments. The entire $4.7 billion authorization has been issued and
additional debt can only be issued for refunding purposes.New York's 'AA' GO rating is based on the state's substantial wealth and
resources and broad economy, and also recognizes concerns regarding the outsized
role that the financial services industry plays in the state's economy and
revenue system. State net tax-supported debt levels have been relatively stable
as a percentage of personal income and are expected to remain above average but
still in the moderate range. Pensions are well funded.The state's financial position has been strained. Revenue estimates for fiscal
2010, which ended on March 31, were revised downward repeatedly over the course
of the year, primarily reflecting reduced expectations for the personal income
tax. Despite gap-closing measures taken, fiscal 2010 ended with a deficit of
$1.65 billion that was carried over to fiscal 2011. The budget for fiscal 2011
was not finalized until early August, more than four months into the fiscal
year, although the debt service appropriation bill was passed before the start
of the fiscal year. A fiscal 2011 gap of about $9.2 billion including the
carried-over fiscal 2010 deficit ($8.5 billion after factoring in budget
measures taken in December 2009) was addressed through spending control,
particularly in the area of local aid, temporary and permanent revenue actions,
including a suspension of the sales tax exemption for clothing and a cigarette
tax increase to $4.35 per pack, and limited one-time measures. Deficit financing
was not part of the gap-closing plan; however, the budget includes a substantial
amount of federal stimulus funds. New York, which spends a larger than average
amount on Medicaid, garners particular benefit from the increase in the federal
Medicaid matching percentage included in the federal stimulus package.In contrast to prior downturns, recovery is expected to be slow, and the state
is projected to confront significant outyear budget gaps as federal stimulus and
temporary tax increase monies roll off. Earlier this month, the state reduced
its revenue forecast and increased expenditure expectations. The current fiscal
year (which ends on March 31, 2011) is now reported to have a $315 million
shortfall to be addressed. The fiscal 2012 shortfall estimate has increased to
$9 billion from $8.2 billion, with the large gap reflecting the phase-out of
federal stimulus monies. The gap forecast for fiscal 2013 is now $14.6 billion,
with the expiration of both stimulus funds and the temporary personal income tax
rate increase. Fitch believes that downside risk to the forecast remains.With steep revenue declines, the state's cash position has been strained. The
state has taken proactive measures to ensure cash adequacy, and continued focus
on cash management measures will be necessary. The LGAC bonds are protected from
the cash flow issues by the flow of funds.New York's employment decline in the recession was less severe than that of the
nation. Nonfarm employment did not start to fall, year-over-year, until November
2008 and was down 2.7% in 2009 compared to a 4.3% drop for the U.S. In September
2010, jobs in New York were flat to the prior year while national figures were
up 0.2% year-over-year. Unemployment remains below that of the nation in
September 2010, at 8.3%, 86% of the U.S. level. Personal income performance has
been meaningfully weaker than that of the nation, down 3.1% in 2009, almost
double the national loss and the fourth worst of the states. The state's
personal income per capita was the sixth highest among the states in 2009, at
117% of the U.S. average.New York's net tax-supported debt is above average but still in the moderate
range at 5.6% of personal income. Most of New York's debt has been issued by
state public authorities and secured by appropriations; only about 7% is GO.While this results in a diffuse debt structure, there is strong centralization
and oversight in the budget division, and approval by the public authorities
control board is required for many of these bond issues.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.In addition to the sources of information identified in the report

The bill is expected to pass the House with ease. “Power Lunch” covered all the bases of the proposed legislation, hosting a debate between Sterling Burnett of the National Center for Policy Analysis and Karen Wayland of the Natural Resources Defense Council.Before we get into the debate – a few notes on the proposed bill: first: it would effectively prohibit oil companies from receiving an income tax deduction – one that was enacted in 2004 for the domestic manufacturing sector. It also requires Big Oil to renegotiate leases issued in error in 1998 and 1999 for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico. If they refuse to renegotiate, they must instead pay a fee. The bill imposes another fee on all non-producing oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.Also in the bill is $14-15 billion earmarked for the exploration and development of alternative energy. Burnett believes we should actually “put the brakes” on alternative energies like ethanol, corn and soy diesel because of the collateral damage it creates for the poor. He points to the doubling of the price of corn in the last year as an example of how this can hurt consumers – especially the lower class.","cnbc, Articles, CNBC TV, Power Lunch, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","At this hour, as crude oil futures are trading below $50 per barrel for the first time since May 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives is voting on a controversial bill that targets the oil industry with higher taxes, fees and royalties.

Although those monies have not yet been appropriated, she says there is a specific criterion that must be met before the cash is doled out. An example would be enacting energy efficiency tax credits and an increase in tax incentives for people buying hybrid cars. She also expects that a huge chunk of the $14-15 billion, if passed, will be given toward the financing of clean energies like solar and wind.Consumers don’t care how much profit the oil companies are making “if gas is selling for $1.50 per gallon,” and nothing in the proposed bill will help the price at the pump,"" Burnett says. He believes the focus should be turned to more domestic production instead and says the bill, as it stands now, will leave the U.S. with a competitive disadvantage as obviously none of the fees or royalties would have an effect on international oil companies or oil-rich countries. As for the portion of the bill that aims to take away the tax breaks that were enacted in ’04 – Burnett says it’s simply unfair as they were designed for the entire domestic manufacturing sector, not just oil. He says the Democrats are just targeting Big Oil because it’s an industry they love to hate.The bill will likely need some tweaking to pass the Senate, but Wayland says regardless of the nuances, it shows that Congress is thinking on the right track. She says the taxpayer dollars that will be used will be well spent because they will  “send a market signal” that the U.S. must wean itself off its oil addiction by no longer investing in the oil industry.",11:45.3

""But science fiction is slowly becoming science fact, and  robotics and AI look destined to play an increasing role in our  lives over the coming decades.""  Mathias added that it was ""too soon"" to set up sector-wide  regulations for such a nascent field of technology, but ""it is  vital that careful scrutiny of the ethical, legal and societal  ramifications of artificially intelligent systems begins now.""  The world's largest technology companies, including Google and  Facebook, have been investing heavily in artificial intelligence,  which is set to power new technologies from driverless cars to  personal assistants. But it is also being used in the medical  profession to help diagnose illnesses.  British MPs said that such breakthroughs raise ""a host of  questions for society, including ethical issues about the  transparency of AI decision-making as well as privacy and  safety"".  They propose setting up a commission that can examine the social,  ethical and legal implications of developments in AI.   The U.K. has been a hotbed of AI start-ups, some of which have  been acquired by U.S. technology giants. Microsoft acquired  London-based Swiftkey earlier this year for $250 million, while  Google bought DeepMind in 2014. Still, Mathias argues that the  government has not taken any leadership on AI developments.   Experts predict that AI could have a huge impact on the  workforce. AI will take 6 percent of jobs by 2021, according to a  study last month by Forrester Research.   Mathias called on the government to make sure education in  schools and training systems are up-to-date to deal with the  workforce change.  ""It is conceivable that we will see AI technology creating new  jobs over the coming decades while at the same time displacing  others. Since we cannot yet foresee exactly how these changes  will play out, we must respond with a readiness to re-skill and  up-skill,"" Mathias said.",11:45.4

A ""mobile addict"" is defined as a user that launches apps more  than 60 times a day, according to mobile analytics firm Flurry,  six times more than the average user.  The number of mobile addicts has grown by 123 percent over the  past year, according to Flurry, which looks at data from 500,000  apps across 1.3 billion mobile devices.  As of March 2014, there were 176 million addicts, up from 79  million in the same period last year. Females accounted for 52  percent of addicts, while the rest were males.  It comes as no surprise that teens and college students are part  of this group as their youth has coincided with the mobile  revolution. Read More5 ways to kick your 24/7 tech  addiction  ""[Teens] are not just accustomed to mobile, they expect their  mobile device to handle nearly every type of task and  communication,"" Flurry said.  ""The same is true for college students who are noticeably avid  users of messaging and gaming apps. They have just entered the  workforce, are predominantly single and are likely out and about  more often than older and younger segments,"" it added.  What's interesting is the number of middle-aged consumers (aged  35-54) that have exhibited obsessive-compulsive behavior with  their mobile devices.  Middle-aged consumers constitute 28 percent of mobile addicts,  but account for just 20 percent of the average mobile consumer.  Female middle-aged addicts fell into categories such as mothers,  gamers and sports fans. Meanwhile, male addicts were parents, car  enthusiasts, gamers and catalog shoppers. Read MoreInstagram passes Twitter in race for US  smartphone users  Researchers, however, noted that part of the high usage amongst  middle-aged users could be because their devices are shared among  multiple family members including their children.  ""The picture we formed is a family of four, with two phones, one  tablet, and all three devices shared by the family for education,  entertainment and more utilitarian functions as well,"" Flurry  said.  Gadget addiction – or nomophobia – has become a growing  concern in Asia-Pacific, the region that is leading mobile phone  sales growth globally.   In the ultra-wired South  Korea, where the average smartphone owner spends over four hours  a day on the device,  the government is looking to take matters into its own hands by  possibly introducing a curfew on smartphone use, according to GlobalPost.    Three years ago, the government implemented a curfew to block  users under 16 years old from accessing online computer games  after midnight  in an  effort to curb video game addition among the youth.   Early adopters of wearable devices  With mobile addicts launching apps over 60 times a day, they are  effectively wearing the devices.  To date, most applications for wearables have focused on fitness  and health. But, developers should think about the other  experiences that will appeal to the people who need to be  connected all the time, Flurry said.

Goldman expects expect that to continue, making it even harder for hedge funds to reverse this trend in the second half.“We continue to expect a slow recovery in the stock-picking environment as macro growth concerns and event risks dominate the investment environment,” wrote Goldman’s Stuart Kaiser, in a note.Funds from notable hedge fund managers such asJohn Paulson, Daniel Loeb and David Einhorn underperformed the market in the first half.Einhorn, in an interview with CNBC, implied that the Federal Reserve’s policy of zero interest rates is making it difficult for everybody.“I think it is actually counterproductive having very low zero rates,” said the manager of Greenlight Capital. “It is sort of just depressing to people. I think it deprives savers of reasonable incomes and the ability to forecast.”It also pushes investors out the risk curve into alternative investments like hedge funds, a losing proposition so far this year.“This shows that investors need a mixed basket of investments, some fixed income, some long stock and some alternative investments,” said Brian Stutland of Stutland Volatility Group.For the best market insight, catch 'Fast Money' each night at 5pm ET, and the ‘Halftime Report’ each afternoon at 12:00 ET on CNBC.

""Civil war has already begun,"" he told reporters. ""The referendum  can put a stop to it and start a political process."" A man  holding a Kalashnikov stood behind him.  The announcement coincided with a sharp change of tone from  Moscow, which had signalled a pullback from confrontation on  Wednesday with Putin's call for the vote to be delayed and a  declaration that troops were withdrawing from Ukraine's  border.  Russian markets sank after surging on Wednesday. In Kiev,  officials promised to press on with their ""anti-terrorist  campaign"" to retake control over the eastern regions of  Donetsk and Luhansk regardless of the rebels' decision on  the vote.  Political analysts said Putin may have expected the rebels to go  ahead with the referendum, showing that they were not under  his orders. By distancing himself from a process that will  not be recognised by the West, Putin may also hope to avoid  further sanctions as earlier measures begin hitting the economy.  Putin's spokesman said the Kremlin needed more information about  the rebels' decision. He said the rebel statement came only  after the Western-backed government in Kiev had declared it  would press on with its military operation, implying that  Ukraine was to blame for the rebels' refusal to heed Putin.  NATO and the United States have both said they have seen no sign  of a Russian withdrawal from the frontier despite Putin's  announcement he had pulled back troops.  When NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasumussen tweeted as  much, the Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted back that ""those  with a blind eye"" should read Putin's statement.  NATO has accused Moscow of using special forces in the separatist  takeover of mainly Russian speaking eastern Ukraine after  annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March.   Putin acknowledged his troops were active in Crimea after  initially denying any role there but says they are not  involved in eastern Ukraine, a densely-populated steel and  coal belt responsible for roughly a third of Ukraine's  industrial output. Read MoreMeet the beneficiaries of the crisis in  Ukraine Kremlin script?  Putin's unexpected call to delay the referendum, followed so  quickly by the rebel decision to go ahead with it, have  complicated U.S.and European efforts to agree a common  policy that might lead to tighter economic sanctions  on Russia.   The European Union said shortly before the announcement that it  was waiting to see whether Putin's words would be followed  by deeds and that the plebiscite ""would have no democratic  legitimacy and could only further worsen the situation"".  At the same time, the Russian ambassador to Paris said Putin, who  had been shunned by Western leaders since the Crimean  takeover, would join them in a ceremony to mark the 70th  anniversary of the Normandy landings in World War Two.  A Western diplomat in Moscow gave voice to the view that events  were still being scripted by the Kremlin.  ""Taking everything into account, I am somewhat surprised with  the separatists' decision. Wasn't Putin supposed to be like  the pope with his dogmatic infallibility?"" the diplomat  said.  The referendum has become seen as a vital step by many in  Ukraine's industrial east, fired up over what the rebels,  and Moscow, call the ""fascist"" government in Kiev that took  over after street protests ousted a pro-Moscow president in  February.  ""You have no idea how many armed people there are in Donetsk  right now,"" Roman Lyagin, the 33-year-old head of the  self-proclaimed republic's election commission, told Reuters  at his headquarters behind barricades of tyres and  car bumpers in the occupied regional administration in  Donetsk. ""There is no man who can move this referendum,"" he  said.  Ballots, printed in Donetsk, have been distributed across the  rebel zone, smuggled through Ukrainian army checkpoints.  Lyagin says more than three million people are eligible to  vote.  Artyom, a rebel at a roadblock in the rebel-held eastern town of  Slaviansk, said of the referendum decision: ""This is great  news. We need to have our say.""   While many Russian speakers in Ukraine fear discrimination under  the new leadership, quite how many support the separatists,  many of whom say their ultimate aim is to join Russia, is  not so clear. Recent opinion polls say a majority wish to  remain within Ukraine, but with a far greater degree  of autonomy.   Putin said his call for the vote's postponement would open the  way to negotiations on cooling down a crisis that has led to  dozens of deaths in clashes between troops and separatists  in eastern Ukraine and rival groups in the southern port of  Odessa. Read MoreAs Ukraine crisis deepens, risk-off  mood grows  On Thursday he again pointed the finger at Kiev,  whose ""irresponsible politics"" had caused the crisis.  Maria Lipman, an expert at the Carnegie Center think-tank in  Moscow, said Putin would have known that his request for the  referendum to be postponed would be rebuffed.  ""But this can be used to show that the people in Ukraine's east  are not Russians, take no orders from Russia, that Russia  exercises no control over them because they only do what  they want to do,"" she said.  ""He has also distanced Russia from the referendum, which has a  completely unclear status and will not be recognised by the  West.""  In a further shift from reconciliation, Putin oversaw test  launches of military rockets during training exercises held  across Russia on Thursday, the day before celebrations of  the anniversary of its World War Two victory.  The West has accused Russia of using previous military exercises  to build up forces along the border with Ukraine after its  Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in  February.  In the rebel-stronghold of Slaviansk, target of a Ukrainian  military advance that began last week, self-declared mayor  Vyacheslav Ponomaryov said a new offensive by Kiev was  coming.  ""We have enough fighters, enough weapons, the support of the  people and we have our land,"" he said. ""God is with us.""",11:46.4

In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday,  Bernanke said loose monetary policy was boosting  employment.    ""We believe the monetary policies we have conducted have helped  get stronger recovery and more jobs than we otherwise would have  had,"" he said, according to Reuters.    Bernanke forecast it would take three more years for unemployment  to decline to 6 percent, further diminishing concerns the Fed  might tighten policy sooner than expected. Previously, Bernanke  has said he will keep interest rates low until unemployment falls  to around 6.5 percent.    U.S. gains may be capped however by uncertainty about whether a  last-minute deal can be struck to avert the $85 billion of  spending cuts, known as the ""sequester"", due to hit on  Friday.    In his testimony, Bernanke warned Congress of the dangers of  failing to reach an agreement on how to combat  sequestration.

In his second day of testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday,  Bernanke said loose monetary policy was boosting  employment.    ""We believe the monetary policies we have conducted have helped  get stronger recovery and more jobs than we otherwise would have  had,"" he said, according to Reuters.

From Iraqi oil output, still struggling to reach its 2003 pre-invasion levels through Iran’s sanctioned nuclear program, the region focuses the world’s attention like nowhere else.","cnbc, Articles, Opinion, source:tagname:OILPRICE","The Middle East, source of much of the world’s hydrocarbons, is one of the most volatile regions on earth, where energy issues impact international relations. From Iraqi oil output, still struggling to reach its 2003 pre-invasion levels through Iran’s sanctioned nuclear program, the region focuses the world’s attention like nowhere else. Now another issue is complicating the mix, Israeli natural gas production. Like Turkey, Israel is a net energy importer — according to the CIA, in 2010 Israel produced a mere 4,029 barrels per day of oil, but imported 238,000 bpd. Natural gas? In 2009, Israel produced 1.55 billion cubic meters, but consumed 3.25 bcm. Israel imports all of its oil and coal and 70 percent of its natural gas needs, leaving the government deeply interested in developing indigenous alternatives, especially as the “Arab Spring” led to Egypt halting its natural gas exports. Which is why for the last several years Israel has been so excited about potentially huge natural gas discoveries. But the bad news is that they are in the eastern Mediterranean, in contested waters claimed by not only Israel, but the Palestinian Authority, the Republic of Cyprus and Turkey. At issue is each country's claim to its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) under the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which came into force in November 1994. Under UNCLOS III, a nation can claim an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its coastline. In March 2010 the U.S. Geological Survey released its survey of the Levant Basin, which concluded that the waters of Israel, Lebanon and Republic of Cyprus potentially contained at least 50,000 billion cubic feet of natural gas yet to be discovered and that in total the Levant Basin could contain as many as 227,430 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 483 million barrels of oil. Accordingly, it is no less a question of what lays beneath the waves, but whom it might belong to. [ More From Oilprice.com: Argentina's Shale Gas Dilemma ] Companies are already moving to exploit the reserves. In February Israel's Delek Group  announced that it has discovered what it estimated to be close to 1.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Israeli waters near the Lebanese border. Delek is working in cooperation with the U.S. company Noble Energy . Israel is attempting to press forward to the swift development of its Mediterranean offshore natural gas assets, the Tamar field, discovered in 2009 and Leviathan, discovered the following year. In June 2011 an Israeli company announced the discovery of two new natural gas fields, Sarah and Mira, about 45 miles off the city of Hadera, while Noble Energy announced that drilling in the 125 square-mile Israeli Leviathan-1 offshore Mediterranean natural gas field had “the potential to position Israel as a natural gas exporting nation.” Initial prospecting estimates of the Tamar and Leviathan fields off Haifa, concluded that the two sites between them could hold as much as 688 billion cubic meters of recoverable natural gas. Accordingly, the Israeli Cabinet is about to undertake the thorny issue of how to defend the country’s Mediterranean EEZ, a mission that will vastly extend the traditional purview of the Israel Defense Force well beyond its traditional nautical frontiers to up to 100 miles from Israel’s coastline. [ More From Oilprice.com: Saudi Arabia's Attempts to Control Oil Prices Continue] Will it be patrol aircraft? More surface vessels? Submarines? Whatever form it takes, the sticker shock is already in, as the projected cost of the new equipment necessary for defending the offshore hydrocarbon reserves is estimated at $718 million, with estimated annual operating expenses of roughly $123 million. Given regional volatility, the reluctance of foreign energy investors to enter conflict zones, the significant cost of protecting any energy facilities, while it is at best rash to make predictions about the Middle East, it does seem safe to say that Israel’s dreams of energy autonomy remain exactly that for the moment – dreams. —This story originally appeared on Oilprice.com.

Analyst are bullish on second-half subscriber growth and the  company is widely expected to surpass its guidance  of 3.55 million net additions — consisting of 2.4 million  additional international subscribers and an additional 1.15  million domestically.   In a research earlier this week, Michael Nathanson, media analyst at MoffattNathanson, said Netflix could add 4.2 million new subscribers,  including 1.5 million domestic and 2.7 million international,  which would bring the company's total paid subscriber base to a  record 67 million.  On average, Wall Street is looking for 1.19 million U.S. net  additions and 2.46 million net additions internationally,  according to StreetAccount estimates.   ""The U.S. has always gotten the focus, in terms of subscriber  growth, but we're seeing international starting to become more  and more of a factor,"" said Tuna Amobi, senior media and  entertainment analyst at S&P Capital IQ. ""I think  international is really starting to pay off, especially since  they've ramped up the launches in the last 18 to 24  months.""  Read MoreAnalysts love the  Netflix price hike  Netflix's international business has been drag on its  profitability as it has increased spending on original content.  The company said it expects to generate material profit on the  global front in 2017 following ""peak international losses"" in  2016. The company hopes to be fully global by the end  of 2016.   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect the Los Gatos,  California-based company to post net income of 8 cents a share, a  decrease of 43 percent from the same three-month period last  year, while revenue is forecast to rise 24 percent to $1.75  billion.    Notably, the company's DVD-by-mail segment, a relic of its  original business model, is projected to contribute $74 million  in profit, nearly making up for the $77.7 million loss expected  from its international streaming business, according to  StreetAccount. The dwindling U.S. DVD business served 5.3 million  members in the second quarter and provided about $78 million in  contribution to profit, while the international steaming segment  lost $77 million.    ""We've seen more spending on content and I think [earnings]  expectations are tempered due to the losses related to the  international business,"" Amobi said, ""I think it's going to pay  off in terms of viewing hours ... they don't break out viewing  hours, but every time they have the trends have been very  strong."" Read More Will this  become the 'Netflix of sports'?  In a note Tuesday, Nomura pointed to Netflix's recent price  increases in Europe and the U.S. as evidence of the company's  confidence in the ""inelasticity of Netflix demand.""    ""We believe the decision to raise prices in the U.S., Canada and  parts of Latin America in 4Q were in part motivated by 3Q's  success in Europe and management's overall confidence in the  subscriber growth trajectory,"" Nomura said.   Last week, Netflix increased the price of its most popular  streaming plan for new members by $1 to $9.99 per month.   Investment firm Wedbush said the price hikes reflect increasing  content costs — as opposed to pricing power.   Netflix is inarguably the streaming market leader, taking about  38 percent of the U.S. video-on-demand market, followed by Amazon  with 14 percent and Hulu with 7 percent, according to NPOWER and  Nielsen research, which excludes broadband-only subscribers.       The company's growing domination of the streaming market has some  traditional media outlets re-evaluating their licensing  partnerships with Netflix — which could be a threat to  its library of content down the line.   Read MoreBattle for  pay-TV subscribers hits the playground  ""Already during the September conference circuit, we have heard  some media executives, most notably at 21st Century Fox and Time  Warner, become more vocal against selling content to Netflix,  which now has 42 million subscribers in the U.S. and has been  labeled the main culprit behind TV ratings declines,"" Nathanson  wrote in a note earlier this week.  Media stocks were battered in August as investors appeared to  lose faith as fears intensified about customers scaling back on  traditional cable packages after Disney trimmed its forecast for TV  subscriber-fee profit growth because of subscriber losses at its  flagship ESPN sports network.    Traditional cable companies are still worried about cord cutting,  but a big pop in Netflix's third-quarter subscriber growth  doesn't necessarily mean that cord cutting has accelerated,  according to S&P's Amobi.   ""Cord cutting is definitely an issue; however I don't think it's  such an issue right now to become overly concerned that somehow  Netflix is going to dominate the overall television landscape,  Amobi said.

""We continue to view Apple Watch as a product category that will drive incremental revenue for Apple, but more important, will offer especially strong stickiness to the iOS ecosystem that will enable Apple to make repeat sales of high-margin iPhones to these customers over time,"" Colello wrote in his note.""The easy money's been made at this point.

188,Video Game Sales Get off to Slow Start in 2011,2011-02-18T00:01:57+0000,Chris Morris,2011 isn't looking much better than 2010 or 2009 for retail sales of video games.,"cnbc, Articles, Activision Blizzard Inc, GameStop Corp, Microsoft Corp, Nintendo Co Ltd, Sony Group Corp, Ubisoft Entertainment SA, Technology, Gaming, Video Games, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","2011 isn't looking much better than 2010 or 2009 for retail sales of video games.Despite comparing with weak numbers from a year ago, game software sales were down 5 percent last month versus 12 months earlier, coming in at $576 million, according to NPD Group, which tracks the industry. Overall, the industry was down 6 percent, dragged lower by continued weakness in the hardware category.The news isn't quite as bad as it might appear, though. January's decline was far better than some analysts had predicted. Wedbush Securities had forecast software sales to be down as much as 11 percent.Hardware sales, while light, also defied expectations — falling 8 percent versus the expected 31 percent. Given that January is always a light month for hardware sales as people tend to buy game machines during the holidays, the decline is far from troubling. Peripheral sales, meanwhile, which included Microsoft's  Kinect and Sony's PlayStation Move controller, were up 6 percent.Year to date, the industry is 4 percent off of last year's anemic pace, with overall sales of $1.14 billion.It was catalog sales that topped the sales charts in January. Activision-Blizzard's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" was the month's best-selling game, while Ubisoft's ""Just Dance 2"" came in and number two. The months' two new releases — Electronic Arts' ""Dead Space 2"" and Sony's ""Little Big Planet 2"" — took the number three and four spots.While the retail numbers continue to decline, it's important to note that brick and mortar stores like GameStop continue to lose market share to digital forms of distribution. In today's gaming market, in fact, they represent just 60 percent of the overall revenue in the video game industry. Used games, game rentals, subscriptions, digital full game downloads, social network games, downloadable content and mobile game apps all contribute to the bottom line of publishers — and are a growing force.Many analysts are expecting retail sales to continue their decline versus previous years in 2011. Some, like Wedbush's Michael Pachter, however, think new hardware products, such as Nintendo's  3DS handheld system, could spark a rebound, and that patient investors could be rewarded.""We think that consecutive sales declines in 2009 and 2010 position the industry for a rebound,"" wrote Pachter in a note to investors. ""However, while we expect a rebound in 2011, we think that the first two or three months face difficult comparisons, and do not expect sales growth to commence until late March, when the Nintendo 3DS launches.""In addition to the 3DS, which is generating advance buzz among players eager to experience 3D games without having to wear special glasses, most analysts expect 2011 will bring hardware price cuts to the industry, which will further boost sales.No console manufacturer reduced their retail prices last year (though each did offer their machines bundled with games and/or peripherals for the same price). Most analysts feel a $50 across-the-board price cut will come before the end of the year.",11:48.3

The new sale, however, has raised concerns that Nvidia could relocate Arm's headquarters to the U.S. and reduce competition in the semiconductor industry.The ongoing global chip shortage has also highlighted how important semiconductors are in today's world. They're used in everything from smartphones and cars to fighter jets and other weapons systems. As a result, nations are keen to become more self-reliant when it comes to chip production, which is currently dominated by China.Set up in the 1980s, Arm licenses its chip designs to manufacturers around the world and it's been referred to as the ""Switzerland"" of the chip industry due to its neutrality. Chipmakers including Qualcomm have expressed concerns that Nvidia may look to close off access to Arm's technology, but Nvidia insists that such a move isn't planned.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has pledged to keep Arm's headquarters in Cambridge and expand the company's footprint in the city.The deal is also being probed by regulators in the U.S., China and the European Union and some question whether it will be allowed to go through. Five industry sources, including two tech investors, told CNBC in February that they think the deal has a very high chance of being blocked by one or more of the regulators.",11:48.4
190,Merrill Taps Thain After Fink Demanded Full Tally,2007-11-14T21:36:16+0000,,"Merrill Lynch'sdecision to name John Thain as its new chief executive came after the firm's first choice, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, demanded that Merrill make a full accounting of its subprime exposure, CNBC has learned.","cnbc, Articles, BlackRock Inc, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, NYSE Euronext, Business News, Leadership, Business Strategy, CEOs, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Merrill Lynch'sdecision to name John Thain as its new chief executive came after the firm's first choice, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, demanded that Merrill make a full accounting of its subprime exposure, CNBC has learned.Thain, who has been CEO of NYSE Euronext for nearly four years, will succeed Stanley O'Neal, who stepped down in late October after Merrill reported huge writedowns from subprime-related losses.Merrill's  selection of Thain was a surprise because the firm had recently indicated to Fink that the job was his if he wanted it. CNBC has learned that Fink said he would take the job but only if Merrill did a full accounting of its subprime exposure. At that point, Merrill, which owns 49% of BlackRock , moved in a different direction and decided to go with Thain instead. A Merrill spokesman told CNBC that ""Merrill Lynch can confirm that Laurence Fink was not offered the job of CEO at Merrill Lynch.""Replacement for ThainThe NYSE  will name Duncan Niederauer, the current chief operating officer, as Thain's replacement.Merrill ousted CEO Stan O'Neal after posting an $8.4 billion write-down for the third quarter. The write-down resulted in a $2.3 billion loss, the largest quarterly loss in the company's 93-year history.Thain has a blue-chip Wall Street resume, with credentials sharpened by running NYSE and his time as a former co-president at Goldman Sachs. Thain took over the NYSE in January 2004 after longtime CEO Richard Grasso was forced to resign over his $188 million pay package. Thain sought to present a new image for the exchange and pushed through some major structural changes, including the move to electronic trading.Thain had also been rumored to be a possible CEO candidate for Citigroup , whose chief executive Chuck Prince also stepped down following big subprime-related losses. No replacement for Prince has been named.Created Global ExchangeThain, who is credited with remaking the NYSE into the world's first truly global exchange, is no stranger to the investment world. He started out on the bond desk at Goldman Sachs and left the firm as its chief operating officer.Many say he's also exactly what Merrill Lynch needs after last month's ouster of Stan O'Neal. The former CEO was not well liked by Merrill's army of some 16,000 brokers, and lost their confidence after the company recorded its biggest loss since being founded 93 years ago.Merrill Lynch ratcheted up a $2.24 billion loss during the third quarter because of investments in subprime mortgages and other risky types of debt. It joined dozens of other major financial institutions who are getting squeezed as investors steer away from riskier securities, causing credit markets to tighten significantly.There is also speculation by a number of analysts that Merrill may take a $3 billion fourth-quarter writedown. That would be besides the $7.9 billion charge taken last quarter. Merrill originally said it would write down only $4.5 billion because of the credit crisis.Faces Daunting TaskThain faces a daunting task of cleaning up those investments, and reviving morale at a firm badly bruised during the past few months. There has been speculation that a new CEO would be forced to turn around Merrill's fixed income division, a department that he once ran for Goldman in the 1990s.Meanwhile, Fink may be a possible replacement for Prince, who left the helm of Citigroup less than a week after O'Neal stepped down from Merrill. Thain was also said to be considered to run the nation's biggest bank.Prince was forced out of his job after Citi's profit fell 57 percent in the third quarter after it booked $6 billion in asset markdowns and other credit-related losses. The night Prince resigned, the company estimated it would need to write down another $8 billion to $11 billion in the fourth quarter.Thain leaves behind a transformed exchange now locked in competition with rival Nasdaq Stock Market. His first task after taking over in 2004 was the acquisition of electronic trading platform Archipelago Holdings. It was the first step in bringing NYSE into the 21st century, which ultimately led to the creation of a mostly electronic market last year.He also shepherded the NYSE's April acquisition of European rival Euronext, which operated bourse's in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon.

""More vaccinations and mask wearing in the areas most impacted by the Delta variant will enable us to avoid the kind of lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and disruptions we faced in 2020.""Several counties across California and Nevada were already advising all residents to wear masks in public indoor settings — whether they are vaccinated or not. In Massachusetts, officials in Provincetown advised all individuals to resume wearing masks indoors after Fourth of July celebrations led to an outbreak of new cases.Experts say Covid prevention strategies remain critical to protect people from the virus, especially in areas of moderate-to-high community transmission levels.The CDC defines ""substantial transmission"" as counties that have 50 to 100 cases per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period and ""high transmission"" is more than 100 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Walensky said.""We have places and counties and states here that are now reporting over 300 cases per 100,000 over a seven day period. So really an extraordinary amount of viral transmission, which is what we're concerned about,"" she added.Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine advocate who has served on advisory panels for both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, told CNBC earlier this month that the U.S. was still ""undervaccinated,"" with about half of the population not fully inoculated.Even people who are fully protected have cause for concern when it comes to Covid variants, Offit said. While the vaccines protect well against severe disease and death, they may not protect as well against mild disease or spreading Covid to others, he said. No vaccine is 100% effective, he noted.""It is not a bold prediction to believe that SARS-CoV-2 is going to be circulating two or three years from now. I mean there are 195 countries out there, most of which haven't been given a single dose of vaccine,"" Offit said. ""Will it still be circulating in the United States? I think that would be very, very likely.""Israel released preliminary data last week that showed the Pfizer vaccine is just 39% effective against the virus there, which officials attributed to the rapidly spreading delta variant. Its effectiveness against severe disease and death remained high, the data showed. U.S. and world health officials said they are looking at the Israeli research, which was not peer-reviewed and was scant on details.Executives from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have said they expect Americans will need booster shots, and Pfizer has said it plans to ask the FDA to authorize boosters as it sees signs of waning immunity. Federal health officials say booster doses of the vaccines are not needed for otherwise healthy people at this time, although they may recommend it for the elderly or people with compromised immunity.– CNBC's Meg Tirrell and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",11:48.7
192,Insurers choose their partners. So how big will the dance floor be?,2015-07-04T15:28:03+0000,Bertha Coombs,"Aetna  and Humana have announced a $35 billion  cash and stock agreement to merge, one day after Centene indicated it  planned to buy its Medicaid-focused rival Healthnet for $6.8  billion.   Should Anthem and Cigna eventually reach a deal to combine their  businesses, it will mark one of the most significant eras of  consolidation in the history of the health insurance  sector. Yet the question remains whether regulators will embrace  the deals as quickly as these rivals have embraced one another.  Four of the largest U.S. insurers will combine to form two health-care powerhouses, and the competition may spur more mergers among  smaller players. ""The effect is going to be very specific to markets,"" said  Christopher Koller, the president of the Milbank Memorial Fund, a  health policy research foundation that advises states.

Still, Koller argues that when it comes to insurance the bar has  been set fairly high by federal regulators.  ""I regulated a  market where a domestic, local, non-profit (Blue Cross plan) had  60-70 percent of market share. And I certainly didn't have the  FTC marching in there trying to take it apart,"" he said.

""I think if you take away that competition, we will see higher  rates and we will see less ability for the states to adjust those  rates,"" she added.With nearly 5 million members, Humana's dominant position in  Medicare plans is one of the factors that attracted Aetna to  purchase its smaller rival. If the deal is approved, the combined  firm would have greater than 50 percent market share in Medicare  in more than half a dozen states, according to a recent analysis  by Susquehanna Financial Group.   That would make one area where regulators may raise concerns,  which some analysts say could be solved by either company selling  off chunks of its business.   ""We expect the deal will close with divestitures in pockets  to address anti-trust scrutiny,"" wrote Ana Gupta, a health-care analyst at Leerink in a note to clients. Gupta raised her price  target on both Aetna and Humana following Friday's announcement.  However, she noted that regulatory approvals for the merger would  take time, as would expected cost savings.   ""The deal is expected to generate cost synergies of $1.25 billion in  2018 and estimated closing in second half of 2016,"" Gupte  wrote. Aetna's chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini said in a statement that  the combined company will be able to reduce overhead costs and  pass on better rates to their customers.      ""This combination will allow us to continue to invest in  excellent service for our members and strengthen our partnerships  with providers to deliver high quality care at an affordable  price,"" he added.  That may be easier said than done, advocates say, and is largely  dependent on how robustly regulators look at the deal's impact on  consumers.  ""Greater consolidation could lead to improved efficiencies,"" said  Elizabeth Imholz, director of special projects and advocacy at  Consumers Union, but only ""if we had a really effective rate  review and antitrust system in place that could look at the  antitrust considerations and also closely scrutinize rate  filings by insurance companies.""While the Affordable Care Act triggers government review  for rate increase requests of more than 10 percent, insurance  regulatory scrutiny at the state level varies widely, Imholz  said.  She hopes federal regulators will watch the proposed  deals closely.""I don't see how the FTC could look the other way if these  big insurer [deals] are proposed, because it's of great public  import,"" Imholz said. ""Even one big one would be important for  them to look at.""One of the arguments insurers make for consolidation is to  counter the wave of deal-making in the hospital and medical  provider sector, which has given some players tremendous  concentration and market power. Over the last 10 years, the number hospital deals have  outpaced insurance acquisitions by six to one on average,  according to data from S&P Capital IQ. Insurance industry consultant Robert Laszewski said he expected strong pushback from doctors and hospitals against the large  insurer mergers.     ""I think there'll be huge opposition from the provider  industry. I think that's what the analysts are missing,"" said  Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy  Associates.   ""There would be so much market clout gain that I think it would  concern people from a competition standpoint, and raise the ire  of the hospital and physician lobby,"" he added.   Consumers will want to be vocal, as well, said Imholz.  ""It is very dynamic out there in marketplace,"" she said. ""We have  to, from the consumer side, be vigilant about what's  happening.""

Even small deals could be at risk to be blocked, especially in a Democratic administration, given the committee's attention to CEO Mark Zuckerberg's emails about how buying Instagram could stifle future competition. Facebook only paid $1 billion for Instagram -- peanuts from today's perspective, where Facebook has a $662 billion market valuation and earned more than $18 billion in profit last year. While Facebook was much smaller in 2012, the committee highlighted several instances of Zuckerberg saying in emails that it was easy to acquire startups, suggesting Facebook could use its market power to throw cash at entrepreneurs who may be tempted by big payouts.Indeed, a revealing back-and-forth between Zuckerberg and Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom highlights this point. Systrom tells Zuckerberg that ""I'm not coming back at you to change the offer (then $500 million) because I don't think that's what drives us. Of course there's a limit to that logic."" Sure enough, Zuckerberg raised the offer to $1 billion and Systrom sold. Further, Systrom told Zuckerberg he had concerns about Facebook limiting his independence to run Instagram as he pleased. Zuckerberg responded, ""You reference flexibility and things you'd like to do independently that you couldn't do at Facebook. I'm curious what you think you couldn't do at Facebook, given that what I offered was for you to keep building out Instagram as a separate product and brand. I actually think you'll be able to do all the same things with Instagram at Facebook."" Six years later, Systrom left Facebook after butting heads with Zuckerberg over how he was integrating Instagram with Facebook. Even if you take Zuckerberg at his word at the time that he had no plans to mess with the company's operations, he knew in the back of his mind that, ultimately, he was the boss. This is true for any acquisition. But with Apple, Google and Amazon all over $1 trillion in market capitalization and Facebook near $700 billion, the ability of these companies to throw money and equity at startups is unrivaled and nearly risk-free when purchase prices are so relatively small.While Kindler may be correct that consumers have benefited from the immense growth of big technology,  a continual stream of start-ups merging into four or five big companies may not only limit technological innovation but also thought innovation. If the same leaders are controlling companies, the same ways of thinking will continue to dictate corporate policy. That's a bipartisan concern. And, in this political environment, that's a rarity. WATCH: Former DOJ antitrust chief: Google, Amazon face the biggest antitrust threat",11:49.0

She told CNBC's Tania Bryer that the ""luxury sector, to a certain extent has been incredibly resilient and I think those companies who have been digitally savvy have absolutely embraced this opportunity to communicate with their customers on a digital scale."" In addition, Swarovski said it had been ""fantastic to see how the fashion industry has embraced this dilemma,"" with non-essential retail businesses in many countries having been temporarily closed due to lockdowns and other Covid-19 public health restrictions for most of the past year. Swarovski pointed to the use of digital fashion shows, in place of physical events, as well as fashion designers ""communicating directly"" more with the consumer. For instance, fashion label Alexander McQueen invited fans to take on various design challenges and share their creations on Instagram by tagging the brand, along with the hashtag #McQueenCreators. Danish brand Ganni also launched a challenge inviting fans of the label to create and send in images or artwork around the theme of ""Home is where the heart is,"" to be selected for a place in an exhibition in Copenhagen and potentially win gift cards. Swarovski believed that more direct dialogue with consumers would help designers become more tailored to customer demands and hoped that would help reduce waste in the fashion industry. She pointed out that a quarter of all clothing produced last year went unworn, or even touched, before ending up in waste disposal sites. Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, showed that on average each American produces about 75 pounds of textile waste a year. ""I think with this direct communication and also further transparency in the supply chain, that will be certainly mitigated,"" Swarovski said.","cnbc, Articles, Alexander McQueen, Sustainable development, Sustainable fashion, Luxury goods retail, Luxury, Jewelry, Technology, Special Reports, Leadership, Business News, Retail, Evolve, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","LONDON — Nadja Swarovski, chair of the Swarovski Foundation, said that the luxury sector had effectively embraced the challenge of operating and reaching consumers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Swarovski, the first female executive board member for her family's luxury jewelry brand, was speaking at CNBC's Evolve Global Summit on Wednesday.

197,Global investors find a new love as consumer confidence soars in emerging markets,2017-08-04T09:36:11+0000,Silvia Amaro,"An increased appetite for emerging markets has grown in recent months, with global investors moving on following excitement over U.S and then European equities.

But with dollar weakness - and consequently a strong euro - set to hurt European companies, investors appear to be slowly shifting elsewhere.""I actually think that it's more likely that investors will shift towards emerging markets … Where valuations are much more attractive,"" James Butterfill, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities told CNBC, noting that U.S. stocks are too expensive.Interest for European equities spiked in the first half of the year with the dissipation of the populist threat across Europe, the election of Emmanuel Macron in France, and the economic improvements seen in the euro zone. But recently there's been some patchy earnings reports and a strong euro is likely to further impact profits. As of August 1, 156 companies in the pan-European STOXX 600 had reported earnings for the second quarter. Of these, 49.4 percent reported results exceeding analyst estimates, according to Reuters. In a typical quarter 50 percent beat analyst estimates.U.S. equities have also been on the rise on expectations of big infrastructure investments and tax cuts by the new administrations. However, President Donald Trump has yet to fully concrete any of these proposals and asset managers are still wary of valuations on Wall Street. As such, emerging markets might become the next sweet spot for money managers.""Investors are starting to see fundamentals way more attractive in emerging markets,"" Butterfill noted.""We're not going to see the taper tantrum that we saw 2013,"" he added, saying that emerging markets no longer have current account deficits. These indicate the value of the goods and services a country imports exceeds the value of the goods and services it exports. The ""taper tantrum"" refers to when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it was winding down its bond-buying program in 2013, which acutely impacted by emerging markets (EM).The U.S. central bank is continuing to tighten its monetary policy - now with rate hikes - but analysts note that EMs are at a stronger position than they were in 2013 and the markets have also priced in the expected Fed moves.""Even with tightening in the U.S., interest rate differentials are still positive for emerging markets,"" Zsolt Papp, EMD client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC.""Emerging market economies are well placed to absorb the higher U.S. rates. Fed tightening comes in the context of stronger domestic U.S. and EM growth conditions and with EM economies in a substantially better fundamental position versus 2013's taper tantrum episode,"" he explained.Apart from stronger current accounts, analysts have mentioned higher growth and lower inflation as other positive factors in EMs.According to data compiled by Pictet Asset Management, strong investment spending and exports have boosted growth in EM countries in the first quarter of this year. Gross domestic product reached an average 4.3 percent across these countries, in comparison with 4 percent in the previous quarter.""EM growth has reached its fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014. The one concern for investors could be private consumption growth, which was flat over the first quarter,"" Pictet Asset Management said in a research note. However, it added that it sees this metric moving higher given stronger consumer confidence, lower unemployment rates and nominal wage growth.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in these countries since December 1993, Pictet also noted.Papp from JPMorgan added that the situation for EM corporates has also improved as recent earnings showed. However, analysts also warned that protectionist policies and some geopolitical risks need to be monitored when assessing investments in the EM world.""Emerging markets have returned 18 percent year-to-date so investors may be questioning whether there is more mileage and returns in this asset class,"" Emily Whiting, client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC.Attractive returns, reasonable valuations and softening in U.S. dollar strength ""are three reasons why it is not too late to invest in emerging markets,"" Whiting added.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",11:49.3

199,Surge in Products Being Recalled May Be Numbing Consumers,2012-06-11T16:32:50+0000,,"U.S. regulators, retailers and manufacturers are growing increasingly concerned that a surge in the number of products being recalled is resulting in ""fatigue"" by the public — increasing the chance that consumers could ignore or miss a recall that could ultimately endanger their health.","cnbc, Articles, Merck & Co Inc, Dole Food Company Inc, Wendys Co, Pfizer Inc, McDonald's Corp, General Electric Co, Costco Wholesale Corp, Stericycle Inc, Business News, Economy, US Economy, US: News, source:tagname:USA Today","U.S. regulators, retailers and manufacturers are growing increasingly concerned that a surge in the number of products being recalled is resulting in ""fatigue"" by the public — increasing the chance that consumers could ignore or miss a recall that could ultimately endanger their health. Consumers last year were deluged with 2,363 recalls, or about 6.5 recalls each day, covering consumer products, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food, according to data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Agriculture and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recalls announced mark a nearly 14 percent increase from 2,081 in 2010 and compare with about 1,460 in 2007.Experts say the increase is the result of a combination of greater oversight by regulators, better testing procedures and the use of social media where consumers can quickly point out and discuss problems with other people. ""We're experiencing recall fatigue in my mind at the consumer level and also perhaps at the business level, and we all have to worry about that,"" said Mike Rozembajgier, vice president of recalls for Stericycle ExpertRecall, an Indianapolis-based firm which has provided advice and helped major U.S. companies, including Merck, General Electricand Wendy's, carry out recalls. ""We have this growing concern for safety, but with there being so many recalls going on (is the public) paying attention to them and responding to them in a manner that is necessary for the recalls to be handled effectively?"" he said. This year alone hundreds of recalls have already been announced. Pfizerrecalled birth control pills after it was found there may have been an inexact number of pills that also could have been out of sequence, increasing the chance of an unintended pregnancy. asked its customers to return about 169,000 high chairs because the restraint buckle could open unexpectedly. And Dole warned the public not to eat a lettuce salad mix because of a possible health risk from salmonella. Retailers and government regulators are increasingly struggling to reach people who may not know about a recall, or choose to ignore it despite the potential dangers. A 2009 study conducted by Rutgers found 12% of Americans ate food they knew had been recalled and 40% admitted never having looked for recalled products in their homes. Increasingly, retailers and government agencies are expanding the methods they use to communicate with the public — from social-media technologies such as Twitter and Facebook to more traditional methods such as phone calls and postings within their stores. But the same methods that prove successful in reaching one customer could just as easily be ignored by another. ""We don't feel that our members are getting bombarded but certainly the general public is and sooner or later you don't know what to believe,"" said Craig Wilson, vice president for quality assurance and food safety at the warehouse giant Costco  . The 602-store warehouse chain uses data supplied from its estimated 60 million members and notifies them within 24 hours if they've purchased a recalled item. It then follows up with a letter. The result is that customers return about 90% of recently recalled products and, in the case of major recalls such as when a food product could cause serious health problems or death, Costco gets ""the majority of everything that was sold back."" But Wilson says the national recall system ""doesn't work as designed"" and that consumers and retailers alike would benefit from a single, uniform network. He says the CPSC, USDA and FDA each have a different recall system with unique requirements, making it more difficult for companies like his to make sure they are complying with the rules. At Rochester, New York-based Wegmans, the grocery chain has a detailed recall plan that can require hundreds of people to carry out. The 81-store East Coast chain follows a recall protocol increasingly common among retailers: posting recall information on its web page and within stores for customers, notifying its followers using social media tools and, when possible, calling individuals who may have used a store card for the purchase. ""We do what we can to protect our customers but then our customers have to protect themselves and they can't do that unless they have the information,"" said Jeanne Colleluori with Wegmans. Last year alone, Colleluori said Wegmans participated in about 40 recalls, and the retailer was ahead of that pace in 2012 with about 16 recalls as of early May. Businesses can ease the burden of a recall on their reputation and bottom line by being honest and upfront with their customers and crafting a response plan before any recall occurs that outlines what they will do with the public, media and regulators, industry watchers say. ""Many companies are being criticized not because they are not doing the right thing but because they are taking too long,"" said Sophie Ann Terrisse, chief executive of STC Associates, a brand-management firm. She said some firms fail to estimate the work needed to conduct a recall and quickly become overwhelmed, leading to slow responses or poor customer service from representatives who don't have the time or know how to respond properly. ""Things can get out of hand very quickly and it's hard to recover from that"" for the brand and the company's core audience, said Terrisse. Companies involved in recalls all say their primary concern is protecting the public — but they also have a business interest as well. ""Our concern is for our customers but we have to protect our name as well, and we are very much aware that when there is a recall if it is a Wegmans brand product our reputation is at stake,"" said Wegmans' Colleluori. Some businesses have managed to take a recall and turn it into a marketing bonanza that benefits the company. Two years ago McDonald's took the unusual step of paying customers a premium to return Shrek glasses to the restaurants following concerns that paint used to depict characters on the glasses contained cadmium — a carcinogen known to cause kidney problems. ""Mistakes can be made, but the way they are dealt with is by being completely open and letting the customer become part of the recall,"" said Terrisse. For Stericycle ExpertRecall's Rozembajgier, the recall surge has turned into a lucrative business for his company, the largest U.S. firm handing consumer product, food and pharmaceutical recalls. The firm has its hands in nearly every stage of the process from storing a recalled product, helping warehouses and stores remove the item from shelves, dealing with customers and ensuring the company conducting the recall is complying with guidelines set out by U.S. regulators. At its five warehouses in Indianapolis totaling 700,000 square feet (about 12 football fields), the firm collects and stores recalled items — everything from household appliance components to sporting/recreational equipment to jewelry. In fact, eight years after Merck voluntarily recalled Vioxx, Stericycle ExpertRecall still has a full side of a warehouse stacked floor to ceiling with cases of the arthritis drug. There are still a number of lawsuits pending, and Stericycle ExpertRecall must keep the drug under lock and key until the FDA says it can be destroyed. ""Recalled products come here to die,"" said Rozembajgier, whose firm has been involved in nearly 3,000 recalls during the last decade. ""If they come to Indianapolis they're not getting back into the supply chain."" The firm has started to recycle some of the recalled items. For example, it has recycled the batteries and plastic components from recalled medical devices; copper from the wiring in electrical products; and sugar has been extracted from liquid medication. The government operates a recalled website, http://recalls.gov/, which offers the public information on all recalls including cars, boats, food, consumer products, medicine and cosmetics. The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service improved its recall system in March by rolling out a Twitter feed that targets consumers only if their state is impacted. In the past, FSIS would send out a Tweet to the 250,000 people who follow everything that happens at the agency. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack downplayed the number of recalls that are announced considering the number of products that are produced, items that are sold and meals consumed each day. ""I think people want to know and need to know and have a right to know if there is a problem with a particular product,"" said Vilsack. ""We're going to look at ways in which we (communicate) and constantly improve how we communicate but we're not going to stop communicating."" This story first appeared in USA Today.",11:49.7

More than 1 in  3 couples met through an online dating site, among 19,000 couples that married between 2005 and 2012, according to  a 2013 National Academy of Sciences study.   Yet an undeniable characteristic of the Internet dating age is  that scores of potential partners are not out for commitment.  Users that flock to eHarmony rival Tinder are notoriously  uninterested in marriage—but that may be because they already are  married. A recent study found about a third of the users of the  fast-growing location-based app are already hitched.   ""Tinder is in a different business than we are,"" Warren  said. ""Tinder is a hookup site. EHarmony takes things very seriously.  We take a great interest in the fact that so many of our people  get married.""

Within the eHarmony site are subgroups for specific ethnic or age  groups. Christian, Jewish, Black, Hispanic or Asian singles  have separate demographic groups, along with singles in their 30s  and in their golden years.     However, same-sex singles are directed away from eHarmony to  another site it owns called ""Compatible Partners.""

Here's how it would work: The DeepLens system would store photographs and names of a user's family and friends in Amazon's cloud service. The camera would then record interactions. And if it all goes right, the AI would then recognize the person and issue a verbal prompt. Solkhan is testing it out with friends and family members as a side project. In recent years, Amazon has increasingly been looking for ways to use tools like artificial intelligence in health care for people with complex medical needs. The company isn't alone. Apple and Alphabet also see opportunities in health, a $3 billion sector that lags far behind other industries in adopting technology.""We see a lot of usage for machine learning from primary care to medical screening,"" Amazon's machine learning and AI general manager, Matt Wood, said in an interview with CNBC. Wood said the camera literally put Amazon's advanced technology, like machine learning and artificial intelligence, into the hands of developers. He described some of the first applications as ""fun,"" like recognizing species of pet dogs. But others are targeted to helping seniors and people with serious medical problems, like Solkhan's device.

(Tweet This)  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will be making its decision on  interest rates. Due to the very robust job growth currently in  the U.S., the Fed is widely expected to confirm that it will  raise interest rates in September.  Cramer gives the Fed some credit, as it held off tightening  earlier because it was worried about the impact of a  Greek-related disaster in Europe. But now that the Greek drama is  over, should the bulls hope that the Fed will hold off again  because of China?  Or will it decide that growth without commodity inflation is a  good thing and not do anything? Or will it say that the U.S. has  wage inflation, so it is time to raise rates?  The ""Mad Money"" host does not know the answers to these  questions. The one thing he does know, though, is that Friday's  selloff was directly correlated to fears that the Fed will be too  hawkish. Cramer did not like that the market refused to rally,  even after receiving some stunning earnings from companies.  At this point if the Fed were to raise rates, Cramer thinks it  would send the dollar soaring, which would prompt U.S. based  international companies to do poorly, which would then result in  negative earnings in the future.  ""In short, I think there is a heightened risk of a further  rollover, but as I always say, this kind of a selloff will give  you an opportunity to buy high-quality stocks at bargain basement  prices,"" Cramer said.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the near-term investing  world is looking pretty bleak. Cramer can see the combination of  lack of market leadership, too few stocks going higher, a general  feeling of teetering all add up to the notion that we have topped  out for now.  ""Here's how I want you to think about it: China is the new  Greece, and the market is not done discounting the possible woes  of the most populous country on Earth,"" Cramer said.  With this in mind, Cramer geared up for earnings next week. Here  is what he will have his eye on:Monday: , BaiduTuesday: DR Horton, DuPont, Gilead, TwitterWednesday: FacebookThursday: Procter & Gamble, MondelezFriday: Exxon Mobil &  Chevron. ""The worst stocks  in this market, perhaps the worst I've seen in ages, are the  oils.

At the end of the day, Cramer doesn't like it when good earnings  mean so little in the market, like they did on Friday. Right now,   the market is all about Chinese pain and Fed worries. Cramer says  to keep all eyes on longer term opportunities that could present  themselves, that have little to do with the Fed or China.  Questions for Cramer?

206,"Week Ahead: Traders look for clarity from China, Fed",2015-08-24T01:00:15+0000,Patti Domm,"Stocks start the week on a nervous footing, with traders looking  for signals from both China and the Fed to turn the tide.  While stocks could see a reflex pop after last week's nearly six  percent decline in the S&P 500, traders see the potential for  the first double digit decline in the S&P in four years and a  possible rocky period ahead. S&P/Capital IQ strategist Sam Stovall said the S&P 500, in fact, could see its first negative year since 2011, if it does fall into a true correction of 10 percent or more. ""Should the S&P slip into a long overdue correction  mode, it will likely take longer than year end to get back to  break even,"" said Stovall. In 2011, the S&P was just very  slightly lower, down much less than 1 percent. Before that it was  last lower in 2008. As of now, it is down 4.3 percent for the  year.

""China's the big one. They've got to step in and do something. I  think the Fed is an issue but it's not the biggest deal. They're  damned if they do, damned if they don't,"" said Robert Doll,  Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategist and senior  portfolio manager.  China Sunday allowed pension funds managed by local governments  to invest in its stock market for the first time. Shanghai stocks  were down nearly 12 percent last week. The Wall Street Journal  also reported that China is planning to announce more steps to  add liquidity to banks in the next several weeks, including  cutting the deposits banks are required to keep in reserve.  Stocks fell Friday in a second day of heavy selling, with the  Dow's 530-point drop the biggest one-day decline in four years.  That index is now in a 10 percent correction for the first time  since October 2011. The S&P 500 also fell sharply, blasting  through key support levels to 1970, for a one-week decline of 5.8  percent. It is now 7.7 percent off its May highs.   Markets have been worried that China's will weaken further, and  the ripple effects will continue to spread into other emerging  markets and commodities. Emerging market currencies were lower in  Asian trading early Monday, after a sharp drop in the past week.  The Mexican peso  last week was down 3.8 percent, the Malaysian ringgit was down 2.6, and the  Russian ruble was  down 6.6 percent, to name a few. Those markets have also been hit  hard by the prospect of a rising dollar and higher U.S. rates,  which would also be a setback for commodities and their  currencies.  U.S. stock futures were lower Sunday. Since Tuesday, the S&P  500 fell about 130 points, with 64 of those points on Friday  alone. Selling accelerated Wednesday, after the Fed released the  minutes of its last meeting. The markets took those minutes as  dovish and immediately began pricing out a rate hike for  September, even though the Fed indicated it was still undecided  at its July meeting. Traders say the next downside target for the  S&P 500 is now around 1950.While stocks were slammed in the past week, buyers moved into Treasurys, but the move in bond yields did not  keep pace with the sharp sell off in stocks.  Nomura rate strategist George Goncalves says bonds are not yet  exhibiting a big flight to quality trade.  ""I think the bond market into the end of next week is going to  operate on its own devices. There are some technical things with  the end of the month. It's also the end of the summer…People  don't want to get involved at these levels,"" said Goncalves.  Goncalves said Nomura expects the Fed to tighten in December but  the odds of 2016 are rising, and the odds of September are  waning.  ""You need another day or two of this volatility for people to  throw in the towel,"" he said. It would take another big swoosh  down in stocks for a major flight to quality trade to come into  the Treasury market. ""If financial conditions continue to worsen,  driving equity declines and credit widen, then the market is  doing the tightening for the Fed.""   Goncalves said market expectations for action by China may be too  high. ""There are a lot of  things the Chinese could do but  not in the short run. We're talking about an area of the world  that has a slowing economy. Their equities market has been  volatile and now they've changed their FX regime. They're doing a  lot. We can't fault the Chinese for not trying to arrest these  market changes. I think that it has to get worse for them to do  more,"" he said.  Read MoreS&P strategist:  Possible negative year for stocksYields move inversely to prices, and the yield on the 10-year yield was at 2.04 percent late Friday. Oil futures were trading lower Sunday night, after eight weeks of  declines, the longest weekly losing streak since 1986. West Texas  Intermediate futures temporarily fell below $40 per barrel Friday  but closed at $40.45 per barrel. WTI was down 4.8 percent for the  week.  The VIX, the CBOE's fear index based on put and calls  in the S&P 500, shot up to 28.03 Friday, a 47 percent jump in  one day.   ""It's hard to know how much of the (S&P) decline, at the end of the  day, was options expiration,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market  strategist at Lindsey Group. ""You have a Friday in the summer  where nobody's going to understand what's going to happen Sunday  night in China. The market is worried about global growth.""  Traders speculated the Chinese government would intervene with a  liquidity injection or some other stimulus. The Shanghai market,  falling for weeks, was down more than 4 percent Friday after a  weak Chinese manufacturing report.  Boockvar said stocks reflect both softer global growth and  shrinking U.S. corporate earnings growth. ""The market is  adjusting to this…. The fundamental story for the U.S.  market has changed because of the Fed, the end of QE  (quantitative easing) and the potential rise in interest rates.  The major tailwinds over the last couple of years has become  headwinds. I think this correction is the beginning of something  more. Could we have violent rally? Sure, but we could also be on  the cusp of a bear market. This bull market has gone on for six  years. People should be more worried about playing defense than  picking bottoms,"" said Boockvar.  But Doll expects the market to come through the downturn and  react much like it has after all of the pullbacks since the bull  market began. ""I think the selloff is more than half way in terms  of points, but less than halfway in terms of time,"" said Doll.  Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. market strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the  market focus will really be on the markets in the week ahead. ""Do  I think there will be some government officials around the world  who speak and that become news headlines? Yeah, but the market  becomes its own story,"" he said. ""What we will be talking about  in the absence of a big data week and because we're not in  earnings season, is really going to be where the dollar is, oil,  volatility and the 10-year and that interaction is going to  basically dominate what happens to the market. That's going to be  far more important than what happens at the company level,"" said  Golub.  Economists polled by CNBC mostly still believe the Fed will raise  rates in September, even though the market now expects it to be  later. There are several Fed speakers in the week ahead and the  important Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed symposium begins Thursday. Fed Chair Janet  Yellen is not attending the conference, but Fed Vice Chairman  Stanley Fischer is attending, and he speaks Saturday.  Ahead of that, New York Fed President William Dudley, viewed as  closely allied to Yellen, speaks on the regional economy  Wednesday, but he will take questions from the media. Atlanta Fed  President Dennis Lockhart speaks Monday, and his recent comments  have been viewed as hawkish since he said he saw no reason for  the Fed not to raise rates in September.  There is some important data in the week ahead, with the most  important release the personal income and spending data Friday.

It has  fallen off of those highs, though, in a big way: Today, the game  boasts just 500,000 daily players, according to App Data –  and may soon fall out of the Top 100 Facebook titles; it's  currently ranked 98th.  (Read More: EA Puts Faith in 'Next Gen Consoles')  EA is just the latest videogame maker to distance itself from  social network (though games from its PopCap division will  continue to be playable there). Zynga, once the king of  Facebook games has been steadily shifting its focus to  mobile games and real world gambling to increase revenues.(Read More: Gaming Industry's Latest Idea: Free Games)   While Facebook officials have recently begun talking up games as  part of the company's strategy, analysts note the site has failed  to find a way to handle notifications without them appearing  spam-like, causing players to lose some interest and developers  to move elsewhere. A Facebook spokesman has disputed this,  recently telling Gamasutra game installs are up 75 percent  compared to a year ago.   While EA won't confirm the shutdown, Playfish staffers seemed to  hint at the situation on the Playfish forums.  The developer  encouraged players to use their Playfish cash cards—gift  cards bought at retail stores that can be used to purchase  in-game items in any of the developer's titles—before The  Sims Social sunsets. ""After that date, you will need to contact  customer service regarding your Playfish cash cards,"" the  developer said—indicating no future games were  forthcoming.  The apparent end of Playfish games is just the latest in a series  of recent misfortunes for EA. In March, CEO John Riccitiello  announced his resignation (chairman Larry Probst is filling the  position in a temporary basis now). In the weeks leading up to  that, the launch of a much anticipated reboot of ""SimCity"" was  marred by online server problems that prevented many players from  being able to access the game, which required an Internet  connection.  And just last week, EA laid off an undisclosed number of  employees as part of a streamlining movement to become more  efficient and sharpen its focus. And that action came days after  EA was named the ""Worst Company in America"" by consumer watchdog  website The Consumerist for the second year in a row. (In an open  letter to gamers last week, EA chief operating officer Peter  Moore said the company could do better, but added the label of  ""worst company"" was undeserved.)  Analysts say Playfish appears to have been a bet that just didn't  work out for the company.  ""In the final analysis,  Riccitiello probably didn't manage the company's cash well  enough,"" says Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities.  ""They  made a lot of acquisitions that, in 20/20 hindsight, weren't  worth it—including Playfish.""  The Playfish acquisition was the spark that led to enormous  valuations and takeover prices of social gaming companies. Soon  after EA's purchase, Disney   laid out $563 million for Playdom—a company which, at the  time, had a much smaller reach than Playfish. And in 2011, EA  paid $750 million for PopCap Games.  Facebook, though, has become a less important platform for games  in recent years as mobile games have shown a significantly  stronger growth pattern. Playfish never really made that  transition. ""The perception was Facebook would grow unabated,""  says Pachter. ""There's still money to be made, but it's hard to  stand out. The opportunity for growth is much smaller than people  thought.""  ""There have been a lot of [developers and publishers] pulling out  of Facebook,"" adds Billy Pidgeon, an independent market research  analyst. ""But I would have like to have heard [EA is] keeping  some other aspect of social. Certainly, they can keep it going to  some degree with PopCap, but most other people are moving  aggressively toward mobile and away from social.""  Despite the recent move, Pachter remains bullish about EA's  future. He rates the stock an ""outperform,"" and recently raised  his target price on the company from $23 to $25 to reflect  improving industry outlook ahead of the launch of next generation  consoles. ""They will have huge earnings growth next year,"" he  says. ""They'll be fine.""  Others area bit more cautious, noting the company seems to be at  a crossroads. ""EA faces a number of crucial decision points  regarding resource allocation and franchise planning in the  hit-driven video game business,"" said Baird Equity Research's  Colin Sebastian in a note to investors. (Sebastian is neutral on  EA.)  And Pidgeon notes that the company needs to become more realistic  with its projections. ""Activision has always done better at  maintaining expectations to the point where they were projecting  growth for each quarter and they were able to under promised and  over-deliver,"" he says.""With EA, it's been the other way around.  And that's not the way to keep investors happy.""",11:51.0
210,Healthcare Market Success: Cave Consulting Group (CCGroup) Affirms Continued Downloads of Free CaveGrouper-Lite™,2012-10-02T15:00:00+0000,,"SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--      CCGroup announced in April 2012 the release of a free download      version of the Cave      Grouper™ software known as CaveGrouper-Lite™. This is the      first public grouper of medical condition episodes-of-care.      CaveGrouper-Lite™ builds longitudinal episodes of care for acute      conditions (e.g., upper respiratory infections, sinusitis) and for      chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma).          The Cave Grouper™ is the oldest and most established grouper of      episodes-of-care in the market today. The first article was published in      1992 based on work formed since 1989. Over the past 22 years,      derivations of the Cave Grouper™ have been applied and validated using a      wide variety of study populations totaling over 90 million individuals      and 705,000 physicians. CCGroup has invested significant time and effort      to determine and develop the most appropriate methods to build      episodes-of-care and to obtain reliable, stable provider efficiency      scores, especially the method on using a predefined set of medical      conditions for a specialty type.     “CCGroup is proud to be the first company to release a free      grouper of medical condition episodes to the public,” stated Dr.      Douglas G. Cave, President of CCGroup. “This is a key phase to allow      all of CCGroup’s methods and algorithms to be 100% transparent for      public use – including health plans, health systems, and the Federal and      State governments.”          CaveGrouper-Lite™ has been successfully downloaded a significant number      of times – and the downloads continue. Dr.      John Rootenberg, SVP of Clinical Strategy, affirmed the following      percentage breakdown by entity type. “20% of downloads were from health      plans; 16% from healthcare consulting firms; 15% from physician groups;      14% from hospital-based health systems; 14% from academic universities      and research organizations; 9% from healthcare software vendors; 4% for      State and Federal Government agencies (such as the Centers for Medicare      and Medicaid Services); 4% from pharmaceutical/biotech companies; 2%      from potential competitors to CCGroup; and 2% from all other.”          A main reason stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ continues to be      the new Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and Patient      Centered Medical Home (PCMH) legislation. “The      CaveGrouper-Lite™ is essential for consistent episode-of-care analytics      and performance measurement,” stated Dr. Cave. “For resource      planning purposes, clinical leaders need to gain a complete view of the      medical condition prevalence of their covered population base. In this      manner, healthcare resource needs may be adjusted with changes in the      condition-specific prevalence rates.”          Other common reasons stated for downloading CaveGrouper-Lite™ included      the following. Clinical leaders stated they need to track medical      condition episodes-of-care to physicians and compare their average costs      and utilization patterns to one another and to CCGroup’s national      comparative database.

Best Co. has assigned a debt rating of “bbb+” to the $1.35      billion 2.75% senior convertible debentures due 2042 recently issued by WellPoint,      Inc. (WellPoint) (Indianapolis, IN) [NYSE: WLP]. The rating has been      placed under review with negative implications, which is consistent with      the under review status of the existing ratings of WellPoint and its      insurance subsidiaries. (See A.M. Best’s press release dated July 10,      2012 for further information.)          The securities are being sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant      to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. If the initial purchasers      exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds from the      offering would approach $1.5 billion. WellPoint intends to use up to      $400 million of the net proceeds for common share repurchase and the      remainder for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to      additional share repurchase and debt repayment.          Although WellPoint’s pro forma financial leverage—as well as its      goodwill and intangibles to equity ratio—is somewhat higher than      similarly-rated peers, A.M. Best views somewhat favorably the financial      flexibility afforded by the convertible debentures. Additionally, the      issuance is consistent with A.M.

The Amerigroup acquisition is expected to close by year-end 2012,      subject to state and federal regulatory approvals. WellPoint’s ratings      are anticipated to remain under review pending the completion of the      transaction and A.M. Best’s continuing discussions with management.      However, A.M.

Their mandate: Launch SpaceX's first batch of U.S.-made satellites by the middle of next year, the sources said.The management shakeup and the launch timeline, previously unreported, illustrate how quickly Musk wants to bring online SpaceX's Starlink program, which is competing with OneWeb and Canada's Telesat to be first to market with a new satellite-based Internet service.Those services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that privately-held SpaceX needs to fund Musk's real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars.""It would be like rebuilding the Internet in space,"" Musk told an audience in 2015 when he unveiled Starlink. ""The goal would be to have a majority of long-distance Internet traffic go over this network.""But the program is struggling to hire and retain staff, the employees said.

Overall, SpaceX employs more than 6,000 staff.As of Tuesday, there were 22 job openings — including a job making espresso drinks — for the Redmond office, according to SpaceX's website.SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Reuters the Redmond office remains an essential part of the company's efforts to build a next-generation satellite network.""Given the success of our recent Starlink demonstration satellites, we have incorporated lessons learned and re-organized to allow for the next design iteration to be flown in short order,"" Behrend said.She had no further comment on the reorganization or the launch window, but noted the strategy was similar to the rapid iteration in design and testing which led to the success of its rockets.Among the managers fired from the Redmond office was SpaceX Vice President of Satellites Rajeev Badyal, an engineering and hardware veteran of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, and top designer Mark Krebs, who worked in Google's satellite and aircraft division, the employees said.

The company is refining the orbital path of the satellites after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which oversees satellites in orbit, approved a request from SpaceX to expand Tintins' altitude range, one of the sources said.The FCC confirmed SpaceX's modifications, which have not been reported previously, but declined further comment.""We're using the Tintins to explore that modification,"" one of the SpaceX employee sources said. ""They're happy and healthy and we're talking with them every time they pass a ground station, dozens of times a day.""SpaceX engineers have used the two test satellites to play online video games at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California and the Redmond office, the source said.""We were streaming 4k YouTube and playing 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' from Hawthorne to Redmond in the first week,"" the person added.In March, the FCC approved Musk's plan to beam down Internet signals from 4,425 small satellites launched into standard low-Earth orbit — more than two times the total number of active satellites there presently.One SpaceX engineer told Reuters the company has studied plans to add roughly 10,000 additional satellites after its first array is live to meet bandwidth demand in the coming 20 years. Behrend declined to comment on the plans and referred to a previous FCC filing, which states an additional 7,518 satellites are under consideration.Such a move would keep it in the race to expand affordable high-speed Internet access to billions of people in rural or suburban areas globally. The Satellite Industry Association, a lobby group, estimates the global market for satellite-based broadband and television services is worth $127.7 billion, dwarfing the roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market.McLean, Virginia-based OneWeb is working to provide internet service from roughly 900 satellites after raising more than $2 billion from SoftBank, the Coca-Cola Company and others.Telesat, backed by Loral Space & Communications Inc, said on Oct. 23 it conducted the first-ever live test of in-flight broadband via a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and was targeting 2022 for broadband services from a constellation of some 300 satellites.SpaceX aims to provide Internet service by linking its satellites to ground stations and mountable terminals about the size of a pizza box at homes or businesses, according to the FCC filing. The U.S. market for broadband is already dominated by several incumbent communications companies, including NBCUniversal and CNBC parent Comcast. Comcast declined to comment on the potential new competition.While SpaceX's model of reusing rockets has generated cash, it is not enough to cover the roughly $5 billion cost to develop its Big Falcon Rocket that Musk wants one day to fly to Mars.""There had to be a much bigger idea for generating cash to basically realize the Mars plans,"" said one of the SpaceX employees.

""We have spent a lot of time thinking about how to grow.""Cornell declined to comment on how much Disney merchandise currently brings Target in terms of sales, or how much of a revenue driver he expects the Disney store expansion to be.Meanwhile, the announcement comes as retailers across the U.S., including Target, Walmart, Kohl's and Amazon, are still vying for the market share Toys R Us left up for grabs after it liquidated last year. Though, the Toys R Us brand is still mapping out a comeback of its own.Ahead of last holiday season, Target added a quarter-million square feet of space permanently dedicated to toys across more than 500 stores. About 100 stores received a fuller remodel in the toy aisles. When it reported 2018 holiday results, Target said same-store sales were up 5.7%, with the toy category being one of its strongest.Disney said it will be opening the first batch of stores at Target right as a new assortment of merchandise from Disney's ""Frozen 2"" and ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" hits shelves. It said it will also sell some collectible merchandise there, like dolls and apparel from its Disney Animators' Collection.The companies explained the Disney stores within Target will be staffed by Target employees, who are set to receive special training ahead of the openings.The mini Disney stores will span about 750 square feet on average, they said, and will be located next to kids clothing and the existing toy aisles in Target stores. Each store is expected to hold more than 450 items, including about 100 products that could previously only be found at Disney retail locations. It has more than 300 such stores globally today.Target said many items will be under $20, with most ranging from $2 to $200. There will also be seating areas in the pint-sized shops for families to sit, listen to Disney music and watch Disney movie clips or take photos in front of interactive displays, it said.People who own Disney gear or visit Disney theme parks are likely people who also shop at Target, according to Bob Chapek, chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. He said there's about a 90% overlap between the two company's customers.""This gives us the opportunity to expand our footprint well beyond [malls],"" Chapek said on a call with members of the media.

225,Why the Cyprus Solution Will Hurt Market Stability,2013-03-25T16:49:04+0000,John Carney,What appears to be the final resolution of  the crisis in Cyprus may not be perfect but it does not stray  that far from the approach advocated here  and on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page last week.  But a good resolution of the Cyprus crisis may not be  enough to undo the damage from interventions that are not based  on clearly stated diagnoses or predictable frameworks for  government actions.,"cnbc, Articles, Wall Street, Economy, Europe, Cyprus, Euro, Credit Market, CNBC EVENTS, NetNet, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","What appears to be the final resolution of  the crisis in Cyprus may not be perfect but it does not stray  that far from the approach advocated here  and on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page last week.  But a good resolution of the Cyprus crisis may not be  enough to undo the damage from interventions that are not based  on clearly stated diagnoses or predictable frameworks for  government actions.   The lesson that policymakers should have learned in 2008 was  that massive ad hoc responses with little public explanation  undermine market confidence. Such interventions, developed  through secret meetings, promote uncertainty and fear. If,  as the gentleman once said, the only thing we have to fear is  fear itself, this is the perfect recipe for producing that  dangerous dish.  (See this paper by John Taylor on how unpredictable intervention worsened the reaction to Lehman's collapse.)The last-minute deal agreed by Cypriot and EU leaders will  impose serious losses on the creditors of Laiki Bank, also known  as the Cyprus Popular Bank. Some 4.2 billion euros in deposits of  more than 100,000 euros will be placed in a ""bad bank,"" meaning  they could be wiped out. Smaller deposits will be  moved to the Bank of Cyprus, which will see its own deposits in  excess of 100,000 euros frozen while the bank is restructured and  recapitalized. A good portion of those deposits—it's  not clear exactly how much—is likely to get converted into  Bank of Cyprus equity as part of the recap.Imposing losses on the creditors of failed banks—including  uninsured depositors when the losses are extensive enough to wipe  out bondholders—should have been the first reaction of  policymakers. Instead, they sought to spread the burden of  propping up Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus by imposing a tax on  accounts of all depositors, including those in healthier banks.As economic historian Anna Schwartz explained five years ago: ""Firms that made wrong decisions should fail."" ""You shouldn't rescue them. And once that's established as a  principle, I think the market recognizes that it makes sense.  Everything works much better when wrong decisions are punished  and good decisions make you rich,"" Schwartz told The Wall Street  Journal.It's not clear why Laiki has to be wiped out. Perhaps its losses are worse than they have let on. But credible sources I spoke to thought the bail-in  recapitalization should have been able to work for Laiki.It's also unclear why the Bank of Cyprus' bondholders have not  yet been wiped out. Depositors should sit on the top of the  capital structure. If some deposits are being converted to  equity, this should only be a last resort after the wipeout of  other creditors. I suspect the answer to these questions is that both banks  were debtors to the European Central Bank. The ECB is  unwilling to take losses on its support for banks, so it has  arranged a scheme to wipe out Laiki while moving Laiki's ECB debt  to the Bank of Cyprus. This isn't necessarily a terrible  policy—but it is terrible that we're left speculating rather  than being given direct answers by the authorities involved.It's striking that this level of public dithering can be combined  with the extreme lack of transparency. One would think that  nothing kept this secretive could possibly look so publicly  foolish at the same time. Once again the Eurocrats have  outperformed expectations.It will hardly be surprising if the fallout from this is far  more traumatic to markets than the Eurocrats expect. They've revealed that they're still making this stuff up as  they go along, that there is no way of predicting (much less  quantifying) the risks of unprecedented policy moves being  undertaken for unheralded interests. Not exactly the stuff  that builds confidence, stability, and trust in a financial system.Follow me on Twitter @Carney",11:53.0

Tuesday saw the first signs of life from the bulls in some time.","cnbc, Articles, CNBC TV, Fast Money, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","PICK A DIRECTION AND GO WITH IT: The headline: Stocks Finish Higher After Fed October Minutes Spark Roller-Coaster The price action in the market was indicative of the beginning of a bottom, Jeff Macke said. Tuesday saw the first signs of life from the bulls in some time. Pete Najarian agreed. Stocks look like they’re starting to find a “smoothing bottom,” he said. As financials fell apart, volatility never spiked, which helped on the rally. OIL RECORD CLOSE: The headline: Crude Oil Surges 3.6% to $98.03; Up 61% So Far This Year The time is right to get long Chevron (CVX), Guy Adami said. It’s cheaper than ExxonMobil (XOM). Investors shouldn’t think $100 is the endgame for oil, either, Pete Najarian said. Look for crude to continue higher after it breaches that level. SANTA’S SLAY: The headline:Target (TGT) Unexpectedly Misses Estimates, Making Holiday Retail Picture Even Bleaker TGT acted terrible on Tuesday, Karen Finerman and Jeff Macke agreed. The fact that its apparel and home furnishings brands – the areas that it has been able to dominate Wal-Mart (WMT) – are no longer doing as well is concerning, according to Karen. Over time, she wants to own TGT but she’s still waiting for a good level to jump in. Jeff Macke wouldn’t play Target either way in this market. AFTER HOURS ACTION: WHOLE FOODS:The headline:(WFMI) Profit Slides But Sales Climb 25% Whole Foods is fighting an uphill battle, Jeff Macke said. The economic conditions aren’t right and the company is about to find itself a real competitor in Tesco (TESO). Pete Najarian said Whole Foods’ increased dividend should be good for a short-term pop. WILL GOOGLE GO TO $900: The headline: Google (GOOG) Jumps 4% After Credit Suisse Sets $900 Price Target Stocks like GOOG, Apple (AAPL) and Research In Motion (RIMM) are starting to find comfortable levels at which to get back in, Pete Najarian said. Guy Adami would rather stick with Microsoft (MSFT), which has the biggest upside on a percentage-basis, he said. Guy predicted MSFT trades in the $40s next year. Jeff Macke also recommended staying with Microsoft. It’s the “easier way to make money,” he said. Unfortunately, they are still years away from targeting stem cells to create organs, Pete Najarian said, so its too early to trade on the headline. In the meantime, he recommended ISIS Pharmaceuticals (ISIS) and Sangamo Biosciences (SGMO) as current plays on cancer treatment. OPRAH’S FAVORITE THINGS: The headline: Oprah Releases Highly-Anticipated List of Her Favorite Things Shares of Williams-Sonoma (WSM) and Deckers (DECK), the makers of some of the items on Oprah’s list, actually moved higher after the list was revealed. Karen Finerman said it wasn’t a “dumb trade,” as Oprah really can move markets. ______________________________________________________Got something to say?

229,Another Hurdle for the Jobless: Credit Inquiries,2009-08-07T15:05:40+0000,,Digging out of debt keeps getting harder for the unemployed as more companies use detailed credit checks to screen job prospects.,"cnbc, Articles, Companies, source:tagname:The New York Times","Digging out of debt keeps getting harder for the unemployed as more companies use detailed credit checks to screen job prospects.Out of work since December, Juan Ochoa was delighted when a staffing firm recently responded to his posting on Hotjobs.com with an opening for a data entry clerk. Before he could do much more, though, the firm checked his credit history.The interest vanished. There were too many collections claims against him, the firm said.“I never knew that nowadays they were going to start pulling credit checks on you even before you go for an interview,” said Mr. Ochoa, 46, who lost his job in December tracking inventory at a mining company in Santa Fe Springs, Calif. “Why would they need to pull a credit report? They’d need something like that if you were applying at a bank.”Once reserved for government jobs or payroll positions that could involve significant sums of money, credit checks are now fast, cheap and used for all manner of work. Employers, often winnowing a big pool of job applicants in days of nearly 10 percent unemployment, view the credit check as a valuable tool for assessing someone’s judgment.But job counselors worry that the practice of shunning those with poor credit may be unfair and trap the unemployed — who may be battling foreclosure, living off credit cards and confronting personal bankruptcy — in a financial death spiral: the worse their debts, the harder it is to get a job to pay them off.“How do you get out from under it?” asked Matthew W. Finkin, a law professor at the University of Illinois, who fears that the unemployed and debt-ridden could form a luckless class. “You can’t re-establish your credit if you can’t get a job, and you can’t get a job if you’ve got bad credit.”Others say that the credit check can be used to provide cover for discriminatory practices. Responding to complaints from constituents, lawmakers in a few states have recently proposed legislation that would restrict employers’ use of credit checks. While some measures languish, Hawaii has just imposed new restraints.Business executives say that they have an obligation to be diligent and to protect themselves from employees who may be unreliable, unwise or too susceptible to temptation to steal, and that credit checks are a help.“If I see too many negative things coming up on a credit check, it’s one of those things that raises a flag with me,” said Anita Orozco, director of human resources at Sonneborn, a petrochemical company based in Mahwah, N.J. She added that while bad credit alone would not be a reason to deny someone a job, it might reveal poor judgment.“If you see a history of bad decision-making, you don’t want that decision-making overflowing into your organization,” she said.More than 40 percent of employers use credit checks at least sometimes, according to a 2004 survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, up from 25 percent in 1998. The share has almost certainly risen today, say career counselors.“It has been an ongoing and increasing issue,” said Mollie de Rojas, district coordinator for the local operations of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.Credit counselors, worker advocates and the unemployed contend that a credit check is not always relevant to hiring decisions.“There’s no relationship between being a personal trainer making $12 an hour” and having a good credit history, said Janet L. Newcomb, a career counselor in Huntington Beach, Calif. “People are being turned down for jobs on the basis of things that really have nothing to do with qualifications.”That is the complaint of Kevin Palmer, 49, who for months lived at the same homeless shelter in Santa Ana, Calif., as Mr. Ochoa. After an interview that seemed to go well one day in June at a property management company, a manager walked him around the office the next day, introduced him to other employees and showed him an available desk.A credit check later, the offer vanished.It was “a glorified clerk’s job, taking homeowners’ complaints,” Mr. Palmer said of the opportunity, which paid about $39,000 and could have gotten him back on his feet after losing his condominium to foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy.Last month, he says he found a job at a property management company in San Francisco — a company that did not run a credit check on him. It is generally legal to run credit checks on job applicants, but some states have restrictions. In Washington, which has perhaps the most stringent requirement, a candidate’s credit history must be substantially related to the job under a law that took effect in 2007.Last month, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a measure that generally allows an employer to review a credit history only after making an offer and requires the credit check to be “directly related” to job qualifications.In California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a similar law. (New York law requires a background check’s findings to be related to the job, but it addresses criminal records and does not mention credit checks.)Lawmakers in Michigan and Ohio have proposed barring employers from using credit history in making employment decisions.“In my opinion, it’s discrimination,” said Representative Jon Switalski, the Democrat who proposed legislation in Michigan. “If you miss a few payments or you have medical debt, your skills as a pipefitter or an electrician don’t diminish.”Courts have not been sympathetic to claims that discrimination is being cloaked in credit checks, said Angela Onwuachi-Willig, a law professor at the University of Iowa. “At what point does the fact that someone lives in a particular neighborhood or someone has a bad credit score become a way of eliminating people for illegal grounds?” she asked rhetorically. “Basically, the courts don’t protect against proxy discrimination.”Stuart J. Ishimaru, the acting chairman of the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said the commission would probably issue guidance on the proper use of credit checks. Such guidance, though nonbinding, could offer some reassurance against lawsuits to employers who comply.“It’s something that intrigues us and worries us,” Mr. Ishimaru said, adding that some job-related tests had led to discrimination claims in the past. “The question is, why do you use it? How is this a good screening device?”CNBC SlideshowsBiggest Welfare StatesBest States for Green JobsRecession-Resistant CitiesFederal law requires employers to get the consent of job applicants before running credit checks, said Pamela Q. Devata, a lawyer in the Chicago office of Seyfarth Shaw.And if they are considering denying someone a job based on a check, she said, “they have to notify the applicant.” That is intended to give someone a chance to explain circumstances or spot erroneous information.When the job market improves and fewer people are fighting for slots, credit histories may become less important, said Michael C. Lazarchick, a career counselor in Pleasantville, N.J. “But these are lean and mean times.”",11:53.3

Now gold trades based on Federal  Reserve comments, interest rates, fear, hedge fund liquidity  needs, etc.  (Read more: With  Paulson's exit, is the worst over for gold?)  It's quite a puzzle to figure out and one we as an asset  manager have decided not to attempt to decipher.  In many ways it's no different than the sentiment-based trading  around Apple.   The company still has over $100 billion cash in the bank; the stock  in the last 12 months has gone from $700 to $390 to $500, and nothing  really has changed on a fundamental basis. This position is  trading based on expectations and sentiment, and we expect this to  continue in the short term. Long term, Apple will trade based on fundamentals; short-term and trades on mood and feeling;  not terribly rational inputs.  The market trades based on data, current perception of that data and future expectations. And institutional as well as individual  investors either know that fact and invest accordingly, or they are  subject to these rapidly changing trading conditions and are  victims.   (Read more: Breaking  Buffett: The Oracle has underperformed)  This is why it is important to understand the time horizon is key  when determining your investment strategy.  If you are a short-term investor you better have a pretty good  handle on mood and sentiment. If you are a long-term investor you  better have a pretty good concept of the fundamentals and trends  that will affect the asset you are investing in.  And perhaps most importantly, remember that when you read  headlines or hear interviews that opinions change and often do.  Use interviews, columns, insights and protestations from those  in the media as information to consider but not gospel and  certainly not permanent ideology.  This means that in the end your opinion matters as well as well  as your interpretation of others' viewpoints.  (Read more: This might  be when the market returns to normal)  So the next time you read a headline that a prominent investor  has adjusted a strategy after making previous statements  about the wisdom of a particular course of action, remember that perspectives change.  Just because you read it or hear it doesn't mean it's permanent, and you should assume that every opinion that you hear is subject  to adjustment prior to relying on that view when you make an  investment decision.

Against the Swiss franc, the dollar fell .The euro had come under selling pressure in recent weeks as signs emerged that weakness in the U.S. economy is having a knock-on effect on the euro zone, fueling the argument for arate cut by the ECB. Some of those concerns eased slightly after German corporate sentiment unexpectedly rose in January, bolstering policymakers' assertion that the euro zone economy can withstand turmoil in financial markets.

245,Why Trump&rsquo;s rigged-election claim is likely to backfire,2016-10-21T12:08:24-0400,,"The news cycle has been largely dominated by Republican presidential nominee  Donald Trump's assertion that the election process is rigged against him.     Trump has repeatedly made this claim since mid-summer, and it was an important topic at the last presidential debate.  But will this help his public standing or create ill-will?  I've studied and written about excuses and blame, and we know a fair amount about when excuses work and when they will likely backfire.    Making excuses is part of human nature.  People tend to care deeply about what others think of them, and excuses are a way of managing others' opinions.     The ""rigged election"" claim is a particular type of excuse called self-handicapping.  Excuses are generally offered after a problem occurs.  In contrast, self-handicaps are excuses offered before an event.  The idea is that by shaping expectations, one will be held less accountable in the event that things go poorly.   An example is a student telling her mother ""Hey, don't expect me to do well on the test today.  The teacher is terrible, he hasn't done a good job explaining the material.""  If the student does poorly on the test, she has deflected blame away from herself and on the teacher and hopefully mom won't be as angry because of the pre-emptive strike.       There is another potential benefit to self-handicapping.  If one offers a self-handicap and succeeds in spite of the impediment, heroes are born.  Think of the famous Michael Jordan flu game in the 1997 NBA finals.  Everybody knew that Jordan was very ill and that the chances of a typical Jordan performance were slim because of his health.  If he had a bad game, nobody would have changed their opinion of him because after all, he was really sick.  But Jordan overcame his illness and had one of his most memorable games, scoring 38 points and cementing his legend.   Donald Trump's rigged-election claim is classic self-handicapping. However, it's important to note that successfully self-handicapping hinges on credibility and believability.    People will evaluate the sincerity of the person delivering the excuse and the plausibility of the excuse itself. People are uncomfortable when they believe that someone is trying to manipulate them. And, if someone has a pattern of making excuses rather than accepting responsibility, it is more difficult to believe the most recent explanation.     Think back to Trump's explanations for his performance in the earlier debates.  He blamed his performance at the Sept. 26 debate in part on a bad microphone that was not noticed by anyone other than the candidate.  The Oct. 9 debate included several complaints about biased moderators, including remarking that it was one on three.     The credibility of the messenger and the message, based in part on the frequency of the rigged-election claim and past excuses, should be concerns for the Trump camp in predicting public reaction to the rigged-election claims.            Many have grown weary of the tone of the campaign rhetoric, which will affect how voters interpret future remarks from both major-party candidates.  Trump's core followers will no doubt accept the rigged election claim as gospel, believing that if he loses, it is because of an unfair process and therefore not Trump's fault.  And if he wins, then he is a hero for overcoming the bias.     However, issues with the credibility and frequency of the claims, along with what some may interpret as their self-serving nature, will likely backfire with many voters.  It doesn't appear that these remarks are designed to spur a change in the election process as much as to protect future reputation.  Self-handicapping can be an effective impression-management strategy, but may also have unintended repercussions.    The rigged-election claim was intended to diminish personal blame if he loses the election.  Instead, he likely will alienate more voters because they don't like being manipulated.

Even if it is determined that the new cluster was not triggered by imported meat, the reports may have already hit consumer sentiment.

Health officials are currently tracking the origin of the new clusters in Beijing and closely monitoring the oubtreak.""The answers lie in careful, systematic, exhaustive investigation of disease clusters to really look at what is happening in these situations and what is causing the amplification of the disease in the human context,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, during a press conference at the agency's Geneva headquarters.""If we get that, we will build up a much better picture of the public health advice we need to give to our communities on what behaviors to avoid, what places to avoid, and what circumstances to avoid,"" he said. —Jasmine Kim2:32 p.m. ET — The Trump administration doesn't want to extend enhanced unemployment benefits past their scheduled July 31 end date, according to White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow.Instead, the administration and congressional Republicans want to replace the $600 a week in extra jobless benefits with a cash bonus that would pay a temporary, smaller weekly sum to Americans who find a new job.Democrats want to extend the $600 payments, arguing that high levels of joblessness will persist past July. —Greg Iacurci1:54 p.m. ET — House Democrats wrote to the chief executives of some of the country's largest banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, demanding documents pertaining to the paycheck protection program.The Democrats, led by House Majority Whip James Clyburn said they are investigating whether the program has favored ""large, well-funded companies"" over the smaller ones the program was intended for.Among the documents they want, they asked for ""all internal communications"" and policies pertaining to the program and correspondence with the Treasury and Small Business Administration. They also wrote to the Treasury, demanding a detailed list of everyone that applied and received loans from the program. They chastised both the Treasury and SBA for not making the need to prioritize loans for underserved communities a part of the program's guidance, despite what they say was the original intent of the CARES Act that established the program. —Lauren Hirsch1:28 p.m. ET — San Francisco has moved into Phase 2B of its reopening, joining other Bay Area counties in easing coronavirus restrictions.The city now allows outdoor dining, indoor shopping at retailers, non-emergency medical appointments and small gatherings, including religious services and ceremonies.

The FDA had warned consumers in April against taking the drugs due to the risk of ""serious heart rhythm problems"" in some patients.Even though hydroxychloroquine is not a proven treatment for the coronavirus, some people across the world took it after a handful of small studies published earlier in the year suggested it could be beneficial and Trump promoted the drug as a potential treatment for the virus. —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.12:40 p.m. ET — The number of patients sickened with Covid-19 across Texas' hospitals continues to climb with the state reporting its sixth new daily high in less than a week.Texas was among the first states to relax its statewide stay-at-home order. In the past week, Wednesday was the only day that Texas didn't set a new record for hospitalizations. It's likely to add to scrutiny from some U.S. lawmakers that some states, including Texas, opened businesses too early.On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that states may need to reimplement the strict social distancing measures that were put in place earlier this year if U.S. coronavirus cases rise ""dramatically."" —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.12:22 p.m. ET — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed that he is planning to discuss small business bailout disclosure with members of the Senate.Mnuchin said he and the Senate will speak on a ""bipartisan basis"" about reaching a potential deal that protects the privacy of recipients of small business loans while ensuring proper oversight of the funds.Mnuchin announced the news in a tweet, saying he will be ""having discussions"" with the Senate Small Business Committee ""to strike the appropriate balance for proper oversight"" of the Paycheck Protection Program loans ""and appropriate protection of small business information."" —Yelena Dzhanova10:10 a.m. ET — The Television Academy announced the precursor ceremony to the Primetime Emmy Awards will be held virtually this year as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus.The event, which had been scheduled to take place on September 12 and 13, awards those behind-the-scenes working in production, design, set decoration, editing, casting and sound.The Governors Ball, the official afterparty for the Emmys, has also been canceled.The Television Academy still plans on hosting the Primetime Emmys on September 20, however it is evaluating safety measures for the ceremony. —Sarah Whitten9:48 a.m. ET — Without ramped up contact tracing and targeted mitigation strategies, U.S. hot spots could ""quickly get out of control,"" former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC.Arizona, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Arkansas and a handful of others have seen an increase in cases in recent weeks. While some attribute the rise in cases to increased testing, hospitalizations, which are not tethered to the availability of testing, has also risen in a number of states.""What these states need to do, what these cities need to do is good contact tracing, not to find every individual who's infected, but to find the sources of infection, the activities that lead to the infection and take targeted mitigation steps,"" Gottlieb said.When reached for comment on Friday, Arizona's Maricopa County Public Health spokeswoman Sonia Singh told CNBC that it adjusts staff for ""contact tracing up or down as needed in response to case count trends."" She added that 90 additional staff are on the way, half of whom have already started.Gottlieb added that Arizona could take responsibility for contact tracing efforts away from the counties and centralize the effort under state leadership. —William FeuerDisclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina.9:42 a.m. ET — From March through May, the restaurant industry lost $120 billion in revenue, according to the National Restaurant Association.The latest sales data from the trade group paint a bleak picture of the industry, which is expected to lose $240 billion by the end of the year. Restaurants across the country are reopening, but capacity limits and new rules to maintain social distancing constrain dining room sales.Three-quarters of restaurant operators say that it's unlikely that their restaurant will be profitable within the next six months. The NRA surveyed more than 3,800 U.S. restaurant operators between May 15 and May 25. —Amelia Lucas9:36 a.m. ET — Stocks opened lower as investors grappled with signs of a second wave of coronavirus cases amid the U.S. economy reopening, reports CNBC's Fred Imbert and Yun Li. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 608 points at the open, or 2.4%.

The blood bank is not testing for Covid-19 itself and said people who believe they may be ill with Covid-19 should not offer to donate until they are symptom-free for 28 days and are feeling well and healthy.Donations given before Monday will not be tested. The organization expects to offer the testing throughout summer months and testing may be extended into the fall. Results will be available around seven to 10 days after donating. —Alex Harring9:19 a.m. ET — Delta Air Lines has received approval from the Shanghai government to resume flights from June 18, according to a Reuters report citing a company spokeswoman. The airline is still waiting for the Civil Aviation Administration of China to decide on how many flights it can resume and when it can do so, Reuters reported. China's aviation authority has said it would allow foreign airlines to increase flights between the country and other regions from June 8. —Melodie Warner, Reuters 8:50 a.m. ET — Germany will launch an app to trace the contacts of coronavirus patients this week, Health Minister Jens Spahn said over the weekend.The country's app is being built with the help of Deutsche Telekom and SAP and relies on privacy-focused technology developed by Apple and Google. Italy's government has also launched an app based on the Apple-Google model, called Immuni.The U.K., on the other hand, says it will launch its own app ""soon,"" but the timing of its launch remains unclear. There has been a rift in Europe over whether to use Apple and Google's ""decentralized"" approach, with Britain, France and Norway opting for a more centralized model. Norway announced on Monday that it was pausing work on its app after its data protection regulator flagged privacy concerns. —Ryan Browne8:01 a.m. ET — Nationwide, about 21,000 people are infected with the coronavirus in the U.S. every day. But that national figure masks regional trends, which indicate that while the virus is slowing in the Northeast and Midwest, it's rising in the South and the West, CNBC's Meg Tirrell reported, citing data from the Covid Tracking Project.While some continue to attribute the rise in cases to increased testing, data on hospitalizations, which is not tethered to the availability of testing, is also on the rise in a number of states, including Arizona, Texas and North Carolina. Some states, such as Florida, do not report hospitalizations. The cities seeing the fastest case-doubling time are Yakima, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Tampa, Florida, Tirrell reported, citing data from investment banking firm Evercore ISI.State officials have responded to the increase of infections in a variety of ways. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has insisted the state's hospitals are well prepared for a surge in patients. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has paused the state's reopening for seven days while health officials reexamine the data and trends. —Will Feuer7:24 a.m. ET — Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and France have agreed to pay an initial 750 million euros ($843.2 million) for 300 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine against Covid-19, a spokesperson for Italy's health ministry said according to a Reuters report.The countries will have the option to buy a further 100 million doses, the health ministry said, according to the news agency. Italy itself will pay 185 million euros for 75 million doses of the vaccine, which is being developed by Oxford University.AstraZeneca announced on Saturday it had agreed with the four countries to supply up to 400 million doses of the vaccine, with deliveries starting by the end of 2020. The pharmaceutical said it was building a number of supply chains in parallel across the world and is seeking to expand manufacturing capacity further. Total manufacturing capacity currently stands at 2 billion doses, the company said.The vaccine is undergoing phase two and three clinical trials with around 10,000 adult volunteers taking part in the late-stage U.K. trial. In a statement Saturday, AstraZeneca said it ""recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical programme with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk."" –Holly Ellyatt7:16 a.m. ET — In an effort to restart the country's crucial tourism sector, Greece has reopened its main airports to more international flights, Reuters reported.Visitors from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union's aviation safety agency will be tested for the coronavirus and quarantined for up to 14 days if they test positive, according to Reuters. Passengers from Britain and Turkey face greater restrictions, and passengers from other airports will be randomly tested. Country-wide restrictions on movement imposed in March helped Greece contain the spread of Covid-19 infections to just above 3,000 cases, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.""You can come to Greece, you will have a fantastic experience, you can sit on a veranda with this wonderful view, have your nice Assyrtiko wine, enjoy the beach,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said Saturday from the Mediterranean island of Santorini, Reuters reported. ""But we don't want you crowded in a beach bar...

But on social networks like Facebook, where people go to communicate with one another, advertisers seem to be trying especially hard to intrude on the conversation.The so-called self-service ads on the site, from the likes of video game start-ups, herbal supplement makers, sweepstakes companies and wedding photographers, are shown on the right side of most pages. Many advertisers who use the self-service system are tempted to go as far as possible in making ads that attract attention and appear relevant, aided by the information that people give to Facebook.“When it works, it’s amazingly impactful, but when it doesn’t work, it’s not only creepy but off-putting,” said Tim Hanlon, a principal at the consulting firm Riverview Lane Associates of Chicago. “What a marketer might think is endearing, by knowing a little bit about you, actually crosses the line pretty easily.”One campaign that flooded the site in recent weeks, before Facebook cracked down on it, tries to take advantage of consumer interest in Apple’s iPad. “Are you a fan of Eddie Izzard? We need 100 music and movie lovers to test and KEEP the new Apple iPad,” one version of the ad says. Louis Allred Jr., 29, a Facebook user in Los Angeles who saw the ad, said he figured it was shown to him because he or a friend had expressed enthusiasm for Mr. Izzard, a British comedian, on their profiles.“It doesn’t seem like they are using the information in sensible ways,” Mr. Allred said.Mr. Allred was also skeptical about the test-an-iPad offer. The ad sends people to Prize-Rewards.net, a site that appears to be based in Vancouver, Canada, and tries to get people to pursue rewards by signing up for memberships in services like Netflix. Efforts to reach the company were unsuccessful.Dan Rose, vice president for business development at Facebook, compared the company’s self-service ad platform to the early versions of Google’s highly profitable AdWords system. He predicted that the quality of the promotional messages on the site would improve as more companies began to use it.“A year ago, we had lower-quality ads, and a year from now we will have higher-quality ads,” Mr. Rose said. “It’s early, but we have made a lot of progress.”The self-service ad system offers any person or company the opportunity to quickly design an ad and aim it toward finely segmented groups of Facebook’s 400 million members, based on gender, age, location and preferences like favorite movies and activities.For example, a promoter can advertise tickets to a band’s concert to the select group of Facebook users who live in the area and have mentioned that band on their profile page or status updates. Or a wedding photographer can show ads only to people in a certain city who have switched their relationship status to “engaged.”“I’ve had good success with it on a limited budget,” said Carter Rose, a wedding photographer in Dallas who has paid $1,700 for Facebook ads over the last few months and as a result booked three weddings at $3,500 each.Many advertisers view a site like Facebook as a good place for playful messages. Cordarounds, a San Francisco pants company, talks about “pigeon matadors” and “trouserbots” that make pants in a “zero-G environment” to capture attention for its products on Facebook.“It’s a conversational medium. If you can be the originator of that conversation, you are fitting in,” said Chris Lindland, the company’s chief executive, who uses Facebook to advertise solely to young men in the 20 largest urban areas.From the perspective of many users, the tailored ads can often seem, at best, presumptuous.Women who change their status to “engaged” on Facebook to share the news with their friends, for example, report seeing a flood of advertisements for services and products like wedding photographers, skin treatments and weight-loss regimens.Then there are the nonsensical ads, which highlight the fact that Facebook does not have employees to review each ad, but relies largely on member feedback to flag inappropriate messages. That allows ads to slip through that run afoul of the company’s policies. “Laws now allow U.S. residents to reduce their credit card debt by more than 50 percent,” reads one ad for a debt-relief Web site, which is accompanied by a surreal image of four tiny babies lying in the palm of a hand.“It caught my eye, but it sure didn’t win my trust,” said Paige Kobert, 32, an advertising employee from San Francisco who saw the ad recently. “It just seemed like a scam.”A Facebook spokesman, Brandon McCormick, said ads like that one and the Eddie Izzard iPad ad violated a Facebook policy that requires the text and photo in the ad to be related to what is being advertised.Mr. McCormick said that in the last few weeks, Facebook had begun enforcing that provision after users complained about the flood of ads aimed at alumni from a certain university or people of a certain age (“Hey, 32-Year-Olds”), with messages that had nothing to do with those characteristics.Such ads are the equivalent of a direct mail “special offer for John Smith” that turns out to be not so special.Facebook users seem most perplexed when they are left wondering why they have received a customized ad.Jess Walker, 22, from central Florida, was recently presented an ad for Plan B, the morning-after pill.“What do I have on my Facebook page that would lead them to believe I would need that?” she asked, adding that she did not want her sexual behavior called into question.Ms. Walker noted that Facebook allowed her to delete the ad from the page she was viewing. — which would then make Facebook less likely to allow that particular ad to be sent to other people.Mr. Rose from Facebook said the ads on the site were becoming more professional and straightforward as the company updated its policies and enforced them.“When you have got the platform that we have, you are naturally going to attract people who are going to game it,” Mr. Rose said.Tech Check with Jim Goldman",11:56.3

That will change in the coming weeks when a company called DigitalOcean starts trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""DOCN.""Buying shares of Amazon -- or Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft or Oracle -- has meant getting a small percentage of exposure to the public cloud. DigitalOcean is different because it doesn't do anything else.The company will start out with a much lower valuation than those other companies. In a Monday update to the prospectus for its initial public offering, DigitalOcean said it expects to sell shares at $44 to $47 per share, which would give it a market cap of about $4.8 billion at the middle of the range. DigitalOcean also said Tiger Global and an entity tied to existing investor Access Industries want to buy up to $175 million in the company's shares at the time of the IPO.Unlike public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services, DigitalOcean is not profitable. It lost almost $44 million in 2020, compared with a $40 million loss in 2019. DigitalOcean is also growing more slowly than AWS, despite that AWS generates 142 times more revenue. AWS revenue in 2020 totaled $45.37 billion, up 29.5%, while DigitalOcean reported 25% revenue growth.That might be okay, because DigitalOcean has a specialty: Simplicity.

""We take infrastructure technology and make it simple across all aspects of the product experience,"" CEO Yancey Spruill, a former operating chief and finance chief at SendGrid, wrote in a letter to investors in the prospectus.Since 2006 AWS has introduced a wide swath of services for software developers to adopt, and its customer list has gotten long, with big names like Apple paying hundreds of millions per year.That's not DigitalOcean's path. It has just a handful of products, including customizable Linux-based virtual machines that it calls droplets, data-storage options, networking tools and three databases. Unlike on Amazon, there are no machine-learning services, deployment tools, database-migration technologies or media-transcoding systems. It maintains 6,000 tutorials designed to help people get going.DigitalOcean also tries to stay simple with pricing and the bills it sends each month to its nearly 600,000 customers. DigitalOcean took a swipe at the big public-cloud vendors in its prospectus, saying their products aren't intuitive enough for sole developers and small businesses and ""suffer from near-infinite feature complexity and have opaque pricing and billing practices that are often accompanied by significant hidden costs."" As a result, the company said, small businesses are often unable to enjoy the benefits of cloud computing.""Companies frequently need dedicated employees, pricing analytics tools or even specialized consultants to understand how products are priced and how to manage their bills,"" it wrote. If DigitalOcean has found a sweet spot, it's with small businesses, rather than large enterprises, which the big clouds have been fighting over in the past few years. It's a self-service business that doesn't rely heavily on a large group of salespeople. In that way it will be like website-building company Wix and e-commerce software maker Shopify.The New York-based company also has foreign reach. Rather than touting S&P 500 clients in its prospectus, DigitalOcean showcases customers such as Bunnyshell of Romania, Cloudways of Malta, Jiji of Nigeria, Vidazoo of Israel and Whatfix of India. In 2020 38% of DigitalOcean's revenue came from North America; by comparison, 68% of Amazon's 2020 revenue came from the U.S.DigitalOcean has yet to take major share in the cloud infrastructure market, though, and some of its customers could end up switching to more comprehensive cloud providers as their needs evolve.But DigitalOcean is hopeful. In the prospectus the company said it expects more than 14 million small and medium-size businesses to be formed each year, and their founders don't necessarily come with sharp technical skills. ""These individuals are able to leverage simple and reliable development tools and the widespread availability and significantly lower upfront cost of cloud computing to start companies,"" the company said.WATCH: Bessemer's Byron Deeter on the resurgence of cloud computing stocks",11:56.8

258,Dow posts 6-day losing streak as media stocks plunge; jobs in focus,2015-08-06T20:00:00+0000,Evelyn Cheng,"U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 1.6  percent, as investors weighed declines in oil and disappointing  earnings ahead of Friday's key employment report. (Tweet This)  ""There's nervousness among momentum investors caused by some of  the outperforming names either missing or giving cautious  comments in earnings reports,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market  strategist at Boston Private Wealth.   ""I don't think much of it is warranted,"" he said, noting some  profit-taking.   The major averages came off session lows in the close. The Dow  Jones industrial average ended at its lowest level in 6 months  and posted its first 6-day losing streak since October.  Stocks extended losses in midday trade as the S&P 500 broke  through a key level of 2,087 that many analysts were watching.  The index closed below that level but held above its 200-day  moving average of 2,072.   Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the next  level of support is 2,063 to 2,067.   Viacom and 21st Century Fox plunged, joining Disney in a  post-earnings stock decline to bring the media sector down about  8 percent for the week so far. At its lows the media sector was  off about 11 percent for the week, on track for its worst week since October  2008, when it lost 21.87 percent.   The media sector weighed on consumer discretionary, off more than  1 percent as one of the greatest decliners in the S&P  500.  Read MoreAmid media carnage,  opportunities may abound  Health care was the worst sector performer, falling more than 2  percent as biotechs plunged. The declines weighed heavily on the  Nasdaq, which closed more than 1.5 percent lower.  The iShares Nasdaq  biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 4.3 percent,  while Apple reversed recent declines to end mildly  higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 120 points lower,  after falling as much as 177 points.   The greatest weight on the index was Disney, which closed 1.8 percent lower,  off an earlier 5.5 percent decline. The stock extended its  post-earnings plunge from Wednesday after the firm missed on  revenue and disappointed investors with subscriber losses.  Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow.  ""You've got some nervousness ahead of the jobs report, lack of a  bullish impetus, narrowing leadership,"" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of  Sarhan Capital. ""The market continues to get weaker, not  stronger.""   He is watching 2,040 on the S&P 500. ""Right now there're less  and less bullish drivers and concurrently more bearish drivers,""  Sarhan said. ""If support breaks there's no question on my mind  (that we get a correction).""   ""Market participants are really groping for a new catalyst to  move stocks higher,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment  strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""There's still some  questions on the economy, the pace of growth.""   He noted there were few indications that the market was strongly  concerned about an interest rate hike, as bond yields held lower,  the dollar was flat, and gold traded a touch higher.   ""The rise in the Treasury market is a take of two separate things  moving in different directions,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Management. He noted hawkish comments from policymakers balanced by ""the continued selloff in commodity prices."" ""It's not all about September, it's obviously about the path of rates (in the next) two to three years,"" Stein said. Friday's jobs report is one of the few key pieces of data expected before the Federal Reserve meets in September and could potentially find enough impetus for raising short-term interest rates. Economists expect 223,000 nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with  unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters.  ""I think this (jobs) report is what everyone's keying on. We've  kind of got mixed messages in the data this week,"" said Chris  Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.   ""I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes  with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes  into play,"" Gaffney said.  Read MoreEarnings? Who cares.  All eyes are on Jobs Friday  ""I think the market is really getting anxious about nonfarm  payrolls,"" said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya  Investment Management. ""If it's a moderate number, then (liftoff)  could be put off, but if it's a really big number  tomorrow—if unemployment is 5.2 percent—the market  struggles a little bit, raise the prospect of a September rate  increase.""  Jobs data so far this week was mixed. Initial claims came in Thursday  at 270,000, slightly below expectations. The private sector  report from ADP showed fewer-than-expected jobs were created. U.S. job cuts in July  exceeded 100,000 for the first time in nearly four years as the  military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian  workforce payrolls, according to Challenger, Gray &  Christmas. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut  46,887 jobs.  However, the major jump in job cuts is not expected to  significantly affect Friday's key report.  ""We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact  on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the  employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs  announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions  announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October  and be implemented over the next two years,"" JPMorgan said in a  morning note.","cnbc, Articles, Markets, Noodles & Co, Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 Index, NASDAQ Composite, U.S. 10 Year Treasury, U.S. 2 Year Treasury, Viacom Inc, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, ViacomCBS Cl B, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc, Fitbit Inc, Herbalife Ltd, Tesla Inc, iShares Biotechnology ETF, Apple Inc, Walt Disney Co, Mondelez International Inc, Chevron Corp, CBOE Volatility Index, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, US: News, U.S. Markets, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 1.6  percent, as investors weighed declines in oil and disappointing  earnings ahead of Friday's key employment report. (Tweet This)  ""There's nervousness among momentum investors caused by some of  the outperforming names either missing or giving cautious  comments in earnings reports,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market  strategist at Boston Private Wealth.   ""I don't think much of it is warranted,"" he said, noting some  profit-taking.   The major averages came off session lows in the close. The Dow  Jones industrial average ended at its lowest level in 6 months  and posted its first 6-day losing streak since October.  Stocks extended losses in midday trade as the S&P 500 broke  through a key level of 2,087 that many analysts were watching.  The index closed below that level but held above its 200-day  moving average of 2,072.   Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the next  level of support is 2,063 to 2,067.   Viacom and 21st Century Fox plunged, joining Disney in a  post-earnings stock decline to bring the media sector down about  8 percent for the week so far. At its lows the media sector was  off about 11 percent for the week, on track for its worst week since October  2008, when it lost 21.87 percent.   The media sector weighed on consumer discretionary, off more than  1 percent as one of the greatest decliners in the S&P  500.  Read MoreAmid media carnage,  opportunities may abound  Health care was the worst sector performer, falling more than 2  percent as biotechs plunged. The declines weighed heavily on the  Nasdaq, which closed more than 1.5 percent lower.  The iShares Nasdaq  biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 4.3 percent,  while Apple reversed recent declines to end mildly  higher.   The Dow Jones industrial average closed about 120 points lower,  after falling as much as 177 points.   The greatest weight on the index was Disney, which closed 1.8 percent lower,  off an earlier 5.5 percent decline. The stock extended its  post-earnings plunge from Wednesday after the firm missed on  revenue and disappointed investors with subscriber losses.  Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow.  ""You've got some nervousness ahead of the jobs report, lack of a  bullish impetus, narrowing leadership,"" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of  Sarhan Capital. ""The market continues to get weaker, not  stronger.""   He is watching 2,040 on the S&P 500. ""Right now there're less  and less bullish drivers and concurrently more bearish drivers,""  Sarhan said. ""If support breaks there's no question on my mind  (that we get a correction).""   ""Market participants are really groping for a new catalyst to  move stocks higher,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment  strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. ""There's still some  questions on the economy, the pace of growth.""   He noted there were few indications that the market was strongly  concerned about an interest rate hike, as bond yields held lower,  the dollar was flat, and gold traded a touch higher.   ""The rise in the Treasury market is a take of two separate things  moving in different directions,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global fixed income at Eaton Vance Management. He noted hawkish comments from policymakers balanced by ""the continued selloff in commodity prices."" ""It's not all about September, it's obviously about the path of rates (in the next) two to three years,"" Stein said. Friday's jobs report is one of the few key pieces of data expected before the Federal Reserve meets in September and could potentially find enough impetus for raising short-term interest rates. Economists expect 223,000 nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with  unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to Thomson  Reuters.  ""I think this (jobs) report is what everyone's keying on. We've  kind of got mixed messages in the data this week,"" said Chris  Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets.   ""I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes  with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes  into play,"" Gaffney said.  Read MoreEarnings? Who cares.  All eyes are on Jobs Friday  ""I think the market is really getting anxious about nonfarm  payrolls,"" said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at Voya  Investment Management. ""If it's a moderate number, then (liftoff)  could be put off, but if it's a really big number  tomorrow—if unemployment is 5.2 percent—the market  struggles a little bit, raise the prospect of a September rate  increase.""  Jobs data so far this week was mixed. Initial claims came in Thursday  at 270,000, slightly below expectations. The private sector  report from ADP showed fewer-than-expected jobs were created. U.S. job cuts in July  exceeded 100,000 for the first time in nearly four years as the  military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian  workforce payrolls, according to Challenger, Gray &  Christmas. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut  46,887 jobs.  However, the major jump in job cuts is not expected to  significantly affect Friday's key report.  ""We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact  on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the  employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs  announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions  announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October  and be implemented over the next two years,"" JPMorgan said in a  morning note.   Oil continued to decline, with WTI crude settling down 49 cents,  or 1.09 percent, at $44.66 a barrel. Brent dipped below $48 a  barrel.  ""I know that a lot of people that are bearish,"" said Phil Flynn,  energy market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""As weak as the  market feels right now the onus is on the bears to take out $40 a  barrel. Really we're following a seasonal pattern.""   In Europe, equities  closed lower as crude weighed on sentiment and the Bank  of England kept rates unchanged.  Analysts said the central bank's position could be an indication  that the U.S. Federal Reserve also holds off on raising  rates.  Read MoreDoves dominate as Bank  of England holds rates  The dollar traded mildly lower, with the euro above $1.09 and the  yen little changed against the greenback at 124.7 yen.   Treasury yields held lower, with the 10-year at 2.22 percent and  the  at 0.70 percent.   Many stocks saw outsized moves amid the slew of quarterly reports  towards the end of earnings season. About 80 percent of names in  the S&P 500 have reported.  There are ""tons of stocks reporting earnings. We've had a tough  morning because they've been volatile,"" said Phil Quartuccio, CEO  of Illustro Trading. ""Earnings (are) surprising on both  ends.""  Viacom fell 14  percent and is in a bear market. The firm matched earnings per  share estimates but missed on revenue as advertising sales  declined and lack of major movie releases from the firm during  the quarter. 21st Century  Fox declined 6.4 percent after reporting earnings that  topped estimates on revenue that missed. The media company also  announced a $5 billion stock buyback program. CBS gained  3.6 percent after the firm reported an adjusted quarterly profit  of 74 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue  essentially in line. CBS benefited from higher subscription fees  and increasing revenue from affiliates.  Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities,  expects some recovery in media names.   ""There's a lot of wreckage after Disney,"" he said. ""I think  things got overdone.""  Keurig Green Mountain plunged  nearly 30 percent after the firm missed significantly on revenue  and sales of its coffee pods fell for the first time ever.  The single-serve coffee company also lowered its sales and  earnings forecasts and announced it would cut 5 percent of its  workforce. Read MoreBad taste: Street  spits out Keurig Green Mountain Fitbit fell 13.6 percent after  the firm reported that its profit margins fell during the second  quarter and would likely stay at current levels for the rest of  the year. That news has put the fitness tracking device maker's  shares under pressure, despite seeing revenue more than triple  during the second quarter compared to a year earlier. Herbalife surged 17.2 percent  after the firm reported earnings that beat estimates on both the  top and bottom line. The nutritional products company raised its  full-year earnings guidance, even as its sales are impacted by a  stronger dollar. Tesla closed down about 8.9  percent despite posting a lower-than-expected decline in earnings  on revenue that beat. However, the automaker announced its second  cut in its sales forecast in the past year.Reports from  Con Ed, EOG Resources, Wingstop, Lions Gate, Great Plains Energy, Noodles and Co., TrueCar, Zynga and Monster Beverage are  all due after the bell.  Mondelez closed up 1.12 percent after news that  Bill Ackman took at  $5.5 billion stake in the snack maker and is considering a  pushing for a takeover.

In June South Carolina filed a complaint against the online retailer, and Amazon agreed in November to take on additional third-party tax burden in its home state of Washington. The issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its ""biggest holiday"" shopping season at the end of last year.

Remember when it went bankrupt and the folks at GM said they'd stop using the GM name in marketing because of its battered reputation? Now comes word GM is planning to change the name of its compact car - the Chevy Aveo. Apparently, Aveo lacks the connection GM is seeking with buyers.Are you kidding me? I suspect there is some marketing consultant or some study showing the Aveo lacks oomph. Hmmmmm. Is it possible the Aveo isn't quite the hit GM would like because the car itself lacks pizazz? Just a thought. By the way, Aveo sales this year are up 12.1% according to the research firm AutoData. That's better than overall industry sales and more than double the percentage increase in U.S. sales. Still, GM fixates on a name.Do they really think a name will dramatically change things? It reminds me of when the company was thinking of putting the GM logo in green instead blue as it was trying to change its image during bankruptcy. Or a few years back when Ford had the idea to kill the Taurus line even though it still had incredible name recognition. Folks, this isn't rocket science. You want to sell more of a particular model, make that model the best in its class. I guarantee you that if the Aveo was the most incredible compact car in the world, it would have huge sales, regardless of its name.

Sources told Reuters last week Mueller is set to become chairman.Commerzbank on Tuesday posted net profit of 339 million euros ($493 million) in the third quarter, after writing down 291 million euros on assets exposed to the market for risky mortgages in the United States. Its profit was below the average forecast in a Reuters poll for quarterly net profit after minorities of 451 million euros. Commerzbank shares rallied on relief that the subprime losses would not be worse, with the share rising more than 4 percent to 28.31 euros by 1330 GMT, outpacing a 0.4 percent gain among European banking peers.Commerzbank said in July that it would book 80 million euros to cover expected subprime-related losses but CEO Mueller said last month that this would not be enough.Like other European banks, Commerzbank had been hit by investor worries about its exposure to subrime risks, with its share down 6 percent over the last two months, even after Tuesday's sharp gain.

Very rich.During the 2008-2009 financial meltdown, Goldman Sachs and hedge fund tycoon John Paulson hauled in billions betting against mortgage-backed securities. Likewise, the financial nerds profiled in Michael Lewis' ""The Big Short"" cashed in, big time. And this is nothing new. Before the UK's 1994 Black Monday crash, financier-philanthropist George Soros, sensing central bankers with their heads in the sand, made billions shorting the pound sterling — essentially borrowing the currency, selling it, and later paying back his creditors when he could buy it cheaper. He successfully repeated this trick as Southeast Asia went into crisis in 1997.Now, the euro zone increasingly appears to be in a terminal mess. Growth has stagnated. Debt is out of control. In vulnerable countries like Spain, interest rates are veering toward usury. Governments are bailing out banks. And Greece has imploded, both politically and economically; this week, citizens have been emptying their bank accounts, always a grim sign that economic Armageddon looms. It’s time for the average person to worry yet again about his job or her disintegrating retirement account. But for the crafty and courageous, opportunity beckons. So, what investments are they salivating over? One obvious option would be to shop for cheap stocks on European exchanges. This ""value"" approach is a time-honored strategy. It’s used by moguls such as Warren Buffet, who advised in the bleakest days of the 2008 mortgage meltdown: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.” Anyone who took Buffet’s adviceand bought US stocks at the nadir of the financial crisis could have nearly doubled their money by now. Bargain hunting is particularly tempting for individual investors, who could shift 401K allocations into mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs) with, say, exposure to Spain or Portugal, whose markets are trading at lows not reached in years. But it's not yet time to pursue this strategy, insists David Twibell, president of Denver-based Custom Portfolio Group. ""Europe is a slow-motion train wreck ... stuck with an unsustainable fiscal mess,"" he says. ""There’s often a fine line between courage and stupidity, and I would say investing in Europe right now comes dangerously close to the latter."" One critical risk factor: If the euro zone does indeed break apart, you may end up holding investments in national currencies that could plummet in relation to the dollar, wiping out any gains from stock appreciation.",11:59.1

And the president also indicated, however, that other tax increases would still be necessary to fund the budget. Do we need a millionaires tax? Will it help the economy grow? And the whole tax plan, how do you see it? Mr. WELCH: Will this—will this tax be on income or wealth? KUDLOW: I think it's going to cover capital gains, dividends and ordinary income, as far as I know, take effect in 2013. Mr. WELCH: Well, look, I think we ought to go back and look at what he's done so far, Larry. He put a stimulus bill in, $785 billion, whatever it was. It did nothing. Now, let's look at what he projected. He projected we'd have 6.2 percent unemployment in October 2011. We've got 9! Larry, if you're in a business and you miss by that much, somebody's calling you in for a chat. KUDLOW: And, in fact, his whole plan is doubling down. Now... Mr. WELCH: Same plan. KUDLOW: ...the financing, it's more spending. I don't want to prejudge it, but it's more spending, and it's temporary tax rebates or temporary tax credits. It didn't work for George W. Bush, it didn't work for Barack Obama 1. Why should it work for Obama? 2. Isn't there a better way? We all know the economy is in lousy shape and it's faltering, as Bernanke said. Jack, with your experience, what's the better way to grow this economy? Mr. WELCH: I would say you start out with discretionary spending. It's 1.3, 1.4 billion. Eight hundred and fifty of it's defense, 450 is total discretionary. Take 25 percent of the 450, that's $100 million, 90 or so. Take 5 percent of defense, that's 50... KUDLOW: Take it out of the budget? Mr. WELCH: Take it out of the budget. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take--but reduce it, not from projections, actual take it out. KUDLOW: Level. The level. Mr. WELCH: The level we're at. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take it down. That's a billion-three or a billion-five—a trillion-three or a trillion-five over 10 years. That's one step, OK? Step number two, freeze regulations. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Freeze them. This Senator Johnson thing... KUDLOW: President Obama mocked the Republican freeze on regulations at the press conference today. I just want to put that in. He mocked. Mr. WELCH: He's shown no ability to lead. Let's talk about that. But let's just take this point. Let's just take freezing regulations until we get unemployment below 6 percent. So, you know, we--just freeze them. The third thing, entitlements. Go after means testing. Lower the age for those below 50. Increase the age till they can get it. Means test. I shouldn't be getting Social Security. I shouldn't be getting Medicare benefits at the level I'm getting them. I mean... KUDLOW: This would provide some confidence, is what you're saying, right? Mr. WELCH: Larry... KUDLOW: Let me come back to taxes. Is it time to raise the tax rates on the upper income? Mr. WELCH: There's nothing that says it should. KUDLOW: OK. Mr. WELCH: All it is a transfer payment. KUDLOW: Right. Mr. WELCH: Take it from one hand, give it the other hand. Doesn't work. KUDLOW: And I think a lot of people are skeptical. So you raise taxes on millionaires, which sounds good. `Hey, get the millionaire. I'll feel better if a millionaire gets hurt.' It'll be spent on spending. It won't be used for debt reduction. Isn't that the possibility here? Mr. WELCH: Everything's going to be spend on spending. KUDLOW: Yeah. Mr. WELCH: I mean, they are spenders. They believe government should do more. They don't believe jobs come from the private sector. They believe government creates jobs. That's just a fundamental difference. KUDLOW: So another part of his news conference today, he was asked about the so-called Wall Street Occupiers, the Wall Street protesters, that's going on around the country and predominantly here but not only here. He expressed a lot of sympathy for that group. And I want to ask you, those guys are against the banks, they're against financial institutions, they're against a lot of things to do with capitalism. Are we going to live through a period of kind of left-wing populism where we're bashing millionaires and billionaires, we're bashing banks, we're bashing corporations, we're bashing Wall Street, we're bashing, you know, Bank of America for raising its debit card fees. Is that the way this election period is going to go? And how's it going to affect the economy? Mr. WELCH: Well, that's all bad news. But it would be solved if we had jobs. KUDLOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. WELCH: I mean, these people have a case. Unemployment at 9 percent. The president promised 6 percent, Larry, in October of '11. That's—nobody goes back and looks at the pledge they made. KUDLOW: Where did it fail? Where did that plan break down? Mr. WELCH: Shovel-ready jobs. People were ready to go, but we had a couple things wrong. Davis-Bacon wages, that changed the class structure. Buy America. A lot of these jobs--and with a penalty if you didn't. So a lot of these jobs, they weren't ready. From the cup to the lip was a much bigger distance. And then to put regulations on top of the stimulus. KUDLOW: So how do we stop this demoralization, to use Governor Christie's word? How do we get back to the Steve Jobs optimism, entrepreneurial model of economic growth? It worked for Jobs, it worked for this whole country. How can we preserve that spirit of Steve Jobs? Mr. WELCH: Larry, companies--I just had a review of my 12 companies in the last week--they're on fire. They're growing revenues at 7 percent average, the 12 companies. Their EBITDA is up double digits, strong double digits in some cases. This economy doing more with less is not good for jobs because it's not growing fast enough. It's growing at a 1 to 2 percent range. We got to get it to 3 to 4, and that's unshackling this government away from it. When I take out 25 percent of the discretionary spending, the same way we did in GE 20 years ago, guess what it does? You give them a soft landing, you take care of the people who are injured. You--we've got a balance sheet to do that. But when they come to work, they don't come to work and say, `What can I do today?' It's when they come to work they cause problem, not the cost of them. KUDLOW: And you're sending a signal. There's a confidence signal... Mr. WELCH: Yeah. And we're going to unshackle business. KUDLOW: All right. So unshackling business, reforming the corporate tax code, freezing regulations. Some tough spending measures from Jack Welch. Who fits the bill for all this in the Republican presidential primary sweepstakes right now? Who are you backing? Can you tell me? Mr. WELCH: Yeah, I'm backing Mitt Romney. Now, whether or not he takes the whole platform, because I want to drill, too. I want to drill on nongovernment land and I want to get royalties from that that are going to help lower the deficit. And I want to have by 2020 total energy independence not from renewables. I want to still support renewables. You don't stop that, but I want to really unleash the energy-driven sector in this economy. KUDLOW: I thought Romney was a greenie. He flirted with cap and trade when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Mr. WELCH: I said he may not follow my whole platform. KUDLOW: What about--what about Governor Perry. Last question, what about Herman Cain, who's actually going to appear on the show later? Mr. WELCH: I hope Herman Cain's serious. I don't think he's serious. I think he's got a book tour he's on, OK, and... KUDLOW: Well, I'm going to ask him that. Mr. WELCH: Yeah. KUDLOW: OK, I'm going to ask him if that's the case. Mr. WELCH: Well, that's one... KUDLOW: But if he were serious, could you back him? Mr. WELCH: I'm afraid he's not electable, and I'm afraid--I think--I think Romney, by the way, will have more trouble in the primary than he will in the general. KUDLOW: So you're looking for a defeat of Obama? Mr. WELCH: I want to take this administration out. They don't understand how to create jobs. They don't understand to grow this—America is on fire. America is still the greatest country in the world. And we have everything going for us except a government that is not supportive of capitalism. KUDLOW: All right. I hear you. We'll leave it right there. Mr. Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric and just a famed businessman and adviser.  Questions? Comments, send your emails to: lkudlow@kudlow.com",11:59.4

The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's foreign reserves have slumped  by nearly $73 billion since oil prices started to decline last year as  the kingdom keeps spending to sustain the economy and fund its  military campaign in Yemen.  The central bank is also turning to domestic banks to finance a  bond programme to offset the rapid decline in reserves.  This month, several managers were hit by a new wave of  redemptions, which came on top of an initial round of withdrawals  this year, people aware of the matter said.  ""It was our Black Monday,"" said one fund manager, referring to  the large number of assets withdrawn by Saudi Arabia last week.  Institutions benefited from years of rising assets under  management from oil-rich Gulf states, but are now feeling the  pinch after oil prices collapsed last year.  Nigel Sillitoe, chief executive of financial services market  intelligence company Insight Discovery, said fund managers  estimate that Sama has pulled out $50 billion-$70 billion over  the past six months.  ""The big question is when will they come back, because managers  have been really quite reliant on Sama for business in recent  years,"" he said.  Since the third quarter of 2014, Sama's reserves held in foreign  securities have declined by $71 billion, accounting for almost  all of the $72.8 billion reduction in overall overseas  assets.  Other industry executives estimate that Sama has withdrawn even  more than $70 billion from existing managers.

By surging in Syria, Putin goes  from pariah to powerbroker  While some of this cash has been used to fund the deficit, these  executives say the central bank is also seeking to reinvest into  less risky, more liquid products.  ""They are not comfortable with their exposure to global  equities,"" said another manager.  Fund managers with strong ties to Gulf sovereign wealth funds,  such as BlackRock,  Franklin Templeton and Legal & General, have received redemption  notices, according to people aware of the matter.  Some fund managers have seen several billions of dollars of  withdrawals, or the equivalent of a fifth to a quarter of their  Saudi assets under management, the people aware of the matter  said.  Institutions such as State Street, Northern Trust and BNY Mellon have large amount of  assets under management and are therefore also likely to have  been hit hard by the Gulf governments' cash grab, the people  added.  ""We are not that surprised,"" said another fund manager. ""Sama has  been on high risk for a while and we were prepared for this.""

Last year,  SolarCity, which is backed by Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk, issued  about $54.4 million in the first-ever solar bonds. They secured  an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's. (Read more: A day in the sun: Solar's  revival sends stocks on a tear)Observers say SolarCity's fortunes are the latest signs of  a maturation process that could hasten the day when renewable  energy is less dependent on government subsidies. It also comes  as demand for solar power is expected to see what research firm  NPD calls ""explosive growth,"" with demand expected to surge more  than 36 percent in 2014.  ""As we're seeing costs and price point for solar systems fall, we're seeing concomitant increase in deal structures and investment  vehicles available to individual investors and utilities,"" said  Nadav Enbar, senior project manager in power delivery utilization  at the Electric Power Research Institute. ""As a result of this  maturity, investors consider renewable energy/solar as a potential  area with less risk for their dollars.""  Solar securities are still largely unproven, and the relatively  short tenure of solar projects–less than 20 years in many  instances–may become a barrier to wider adoption of solar  financing.  Still, the move toward tapping capital markets means green  projects could make the sector less vulnerable to the backlash  that often ensues from using public funds. Private investors are  starting to warm to the idea: US Bank has a alternative energy  arm that has doled out more than $1.7 billion to a spate of  renewable projects in the U.S.  A steep drop in solar prices and costs—data from the Solar  Energy Industries Association says sun-power is now 60 percent  cheaper than it was just a few short years ago—is fueling  strong demand.   According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), growth  in renewable power generation is expected to exceed 858 billion  kilowatt hours by 2040, with a bulk of that growth coming from  solar. Renewables generated 524 billion kilowatt hours in  2011.  Because solar power can be generated at the local level, and  because its infrastructure can be built easily without the  politically-tinged problems that accompany crude, it makes for a  comparatively attractive investment. (Read more: Critics question 'green  loans,' but US points to the numbers)  Mike Sheppard, senior energy and power analyst with research IHS,  says investors ""see it as a trend…that opens up new sources  of capital investment from people not yet willing to risk money  in technology"" that may not be proven, he added.  ""Securitization smooths out [risks], diversifying over multiple  projects,"" Sheppard said.

285,Fed likely to reassure markets that it is watchful of coronavirus impact,2020-01-27T22:17:55+0000,Patti Domm,"The Fed is not expected to take any action on its benchmark fed funds rate this week, but it is likely to reassure markets that it is watching the outbreak of the coronavirus and other geopolitical uncertainties.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to brief the press after the Fed releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, and it is in those comments investors will likely get the most insight into the Fed's thinking. The Fed starts its two-day meeting Tuesday.""They might say something about paying attention to global developments, but I wouldn't expect them to do anything at this point,"" said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Strategists expect the Fed has been watching tensions in the Middle East and now the coronavirus.""They're looking at the global economy and it doesn't look like it will have much affect at the moment,"" he said. It is still unclear how serious the virus will become, or how it will impact the Chinese and other economies.

""They've come into 2020 with their work done. This is a political year. They've done their job when it comes to cutting rates. I think they're in wait-and-see mode.""The biggest issue for markets is when the Fed will slow and ultimately stop its purchases of Treasury bills, an effort credited by some for a surge in liquidity that has helped boost risk assets, particularly stocks, and tighten credit spreads. The Fed began purchasing $60 billion a month to expand its balance sheet and increases reserves, after problems in the short-term funding market created a temporary snap up in overnight rates.The Fed has calmed the short-term lending market with the purchases and also ongoing repurchase, or repo, operations. It has said it would continue its operations to help the repo market through the tax season, when there could be higher-than-normal demand for short-term cash. The repo market is basically the plumbing for the financial markets and is where financial institutions go for short term cash.""It would be nice if they did discuss it, but I don't know if they're going to or not,"" said John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets. Briggs said he doesn't expect Powell to reveal much in the way of specifics on how it will wind down its Treasury bill purchases. He expects the Fed to say in March that it is paring back those purchases from $60 billion to $40 billion, and then will taper them down.BlackRock's Rick Rieder said he will be listening for how the Fed describes inflation since it has said it is willing to let it run ""hotter"" than its 2% target, though the measure it watches has not yet met the target. He, too, is looking for clarification on the Fed's plans for its T-bill buying program.He expects the Fed to discuss it by mid-second quarter. ""I think they'll start to taper it down, and I think they'll be very deliberate and prescriptive about how they're going to do that,"" said Rieder, BlackRock's global CIO of fixed income.He said the Fed is adding a lot of liquidity to the financial system on its own, but it is even more massive when combined with the efforts of the People's Bank of China and the European Central Bank.""I think they'll start to taper down the program some time during or toward the middle or the end of the second quarter,"" he said. ""My sense is they're beginning the discussions but those discussions will gather momentum in the next month or two.""Rieder said he expects more Fed officials to become concerned about their policy causing too easy financial conditions, boosting stocks and tightening credit spreads. ""My sense is that's going to be very slow in incubating that idea.""""The one thing I've got my eye on is I think at some point in the next couple of months, assuming what is happening now is a relatively near term risk, I think a lot of the discussion is going to head toward financial conditions,"" Rieder said. ""You've had some of the Fed members talking about financial conditions.""The Fed is also expected to boost the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. That's a technical tool that it would hope would push its fed funds rate slightly higher. The fed funds rate has been at 1.55%, the low end of its 1.50 to 1.75% range.""Historically, the Fed has made these adjustments when the funds rate has been trading within 5 basis points of the borders of the target range, as it has recently,"" notes JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli.

The ban, which took effect at midnight, would also apply to credit default swaps based on those bonds.

""Really all they do is channel more of the market risk takers into expressing their negative view on the euro zone into the currency.""""It says a lot of why the euro went to a new four-year low today, and that was after spending most of the day strengthening and squeezing out short positions. In any crisis, there's always going to be policy mistakes. Some of the mistakes are going to be bigger than others. This has the potential to be quite big. It may not be a Lehman mistake, but it's right up there,"" he said.However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist with Pierpont Securities, said he doesn't believe the moves will make that much of a difference unless other countries join Germany. ""From what I read, it looks like it's really mostly symbolic. They clearly have the ability and authority to prevent short selling on those German stocks, but I don't think this has much teeth when it comes to euro bonds and CDS... Much more of those trade in London than in Germany,"" he said.Goldman Sachs' European economists, meanwhile, said they believe the move was made by German officials to make the expected passage of the $440 billion euro bailout package Friday more palatable to the German parliament. They also say they expect other countries to follow Germany's lead.The new rules are valid until next March 31, and it appears to have some exemptions for market makers who need to hedge.The news leaked out after European markets were closed, but it rattled U.S. investors who remembered U.S. regulators banning short selling in financial stocks during the thick of the financial crisis.""What bothers people here, in as much as it smacks of desperation, is when we got to the stage where we were eliminating short selling, we were in deep, deep trouble. I wouldn't have thought the situation was so dire over there to take those actions. It's pretty clear policy makers are out of control, and they're flailing around. That's not going to make the euro stop going down,"" said Barry Knapp, head of U.S. equities strategy at Barclays Capital.Fin RegCongressional efforts to enact financial regulatory reform legislation has been a long process, and now that the Senate moves toward a potential vote later this week, the market is taking more notice. The S&P financial sector was down nearly 2.8 percent Tuesday, giving it a 7.8 percent decline this month.""I don't think people had really done the analysis on this, and all of the sudden, we're at the verge of it, and now people are putting pen to paper and they're saying 'wow,' he said. Knapp said if rules similar to Basile III capital standards were applied to U.S. banks, the top 20 banks would need an additional $160 billion in capital.More From CNBC.com:Slideshow: The World's Biggest Debtor NationsGovernment Debt Issuers Most Likely to DefaultEven after the Senate approves a bill, the final shape of legislation will still be unclear. The Senate bill will have to be reconciled with a bill passed previously by the House of Representatives.""It all adds up to the same thing, which is a pretty big hit to the forward earnings outlook. It is also unclear for what it means for credit creation and the economy,"" he said.""The problem with fin reg here is if you get a vote on, let's say Thursday night, you've got headline risk the day before an (options) expiration. Just from a market perspective, that's added a level of complexity. That's just not what traders want to deal with,"" Knapp said. Goldman Sachs analysts Monday issued a report saying the proposals so far in the regulatory reform bill present about 20 percent risk to normalized earnings per share for banks. They also said the moves in CDS and options markets imply the stocks of financials may be about 6 percent too expensive.Widely followed bank analyst Meredith Whitney also Monday said that she would avoid the group, as regulatory reform will dent their earnings and restrict lending.On Tuesday, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. made moves to compromise on a key and controversial feature of the Senate bill which would force banks to spin off their swaps desk. Dodd suggested a proposal to delay any ban on bank derivatives operations for two years while federal regulators study the potential impact. But Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., who proposed the rule said she would fight any effort to weaken it.What Else to WatchConsumer price index inflation data is released at 8:30 a.m., and minutes of the Fed's last meeting will be released at 2 p.m. Stanley said the market more likely than not will brush off the Fed minutes. ""The meeting was before the European stuff came to a head...It's pretty clear to me that the Fed reaction in all of this has been pretty cautious and aggressive, opening up swap lines again and the rhetoric..It takes teeth out of any hawkish noise coming out of those minutes. People will dismiss it as old news. If it's dovish, people could say, 'geez, if they were dovish before all this happened, where are they now?'"" he said.Stanley said he had been expecting the Fed to move toward a tighter monetary policy by September, but now thinks the Fed will wait until next year because of the European situation.Hewlett-Packard, meanwhile, may get some focus after it reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full year outlook after Tuesday's bell. The company earned $2.2 billion on revenues of $30.8 billion. Earnings Wednesday include Target ,Limited Brands , and Polo Ralph Lauren .Knapp pointed to the decline in consumer discretionary stocks Tuesday, even after some good retail earnings.""This is the stage in the economic cycle where you would expect consumer discretionary would have been a big winner, and it's not trading particularly well... Some of it's cyclical rotation..but I'm not so sure I want to say it's a bad sign about the economy. It does tell you there were a lot of people in the trade. You put all these things together -- You have fin reg. You have the euro going down and you have retailers not responding to good earnings and that's making for a pretty good drubbing I suppose,"" said Knapp.Who Dunnit?The SEC and CFTC still don't know what caused the market plunge May 6, but they will continue to study it and they have six scenarios they are pursuing.  Those include a mismatch in liquidity, disparate trading rules, and linkages between the decline in stock index products such as index ETFs and the e-mini S&P 500 futures.They did say they found no evidence of a fat finger trade, computer hacking or terrorist activity but they could not completely rule out those possibilities either.  The SEC issued new rules on single stock circuit breakers, where it would require a five minute trading halt if the price declines by 10 percent in a five minute period.

290,Colombian Oil: Is It Time To Invest?,2012-08-30T19:26:04+0000,,"Investors—Canadian ones, in particular—may recall Colombia as one of the hottest oil plays in the world.","cnbc, Articles, Markets, stocks, Stock Blog, source:tagname:OILPRICE","Investors—Canadian ones, in particular—may recall Colombia as one of the hottest oil plays in the world. That was just a few years ago. Huge wells in these plays created huge valuations—and some strong runs for stocks like Pacific Rubiales and Petrominerales.Today of course is a different story, with stock prices having fallen off the map—despite favorable oil prices. So what happened that caused these sharp share price drops? And are there good reasons for investors to turn back again to Colombia's oil plays? We asked Fred Kozak for his insights—He's an independent oil and gas analyst, formerly with the Canadian brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity. “Colombia still has FARC issues, environmental permitting is still a big problem and pipeline constraints are all impacting the investment climate,” he said in an interview. FARC is the Spanish acronym for the left wing guerrilla movement in Colombia. Former President Alvaro Uribe was able to secure billions of dollars in US aid in the last decade, which was used for the military and other means to reduce the FARC’s impact on the country. [ More From Oilprice.com: Why It's Time to Invest in Iran's Renewable Energy ]With the FARC risk down considerably, foreign investors felt secure in investing billions of private capital into the country’s energy sector—especially the upstream oil and gas producers. The Canadians were quite active then, led by companies like Frank Giustra’s and Serafino Iacono’s Pacific Rubiales and John Wright’s and Corey Ruttan’s Petrominerales. Both companies had great success developing assets in the Llanos Basin in the middle of the country, and both had exceptional stock runs. PRE skyrocketed from $2-$34 in 2009-2010, and PMG rose from $6-$40. A Perfect Storm of Oil Exploration It all happened at the same time: There was a perfect storm of exploration success, a lower royalty rate, and the sense that this under-explored country could continue its string of high profile discoveries for years. Promoters created new junior exploration companies with bloated share counts—hundreds of millions of shares out—and investors jumped all over these opportunities. These days? In what I would refer to as the senior Colombian stocks—Rubiales, Gran Tierra—they’re just above 50 percent of their highs, and the rest are anywhere from 20-50 percent of their highs. That second round of bloated share-count juniors quickly lost 80 percent of their value, and have only recently popped their head up. Did anybody get the license plate on the truck that ran over these stocks? It was actually several trucks, says Kozak. He says one of the big factors hitting these stocks was the Arab Spring of 2011—all international juniors the world over sold off after institutional and retail investors lost their appetite for foreign risk, as dictators got toppled one after the other starting in early 2011. And sadly for everyone, FARC violence has increased this year. After several years of declining activity, brokerage firm Raymond James reports in an Aug. 13 report that there has been a “material” increase of security incidents reported since the beginning of the year. Pipeline attacks increased three-fold year-over-year, and five Ecopetrol contractors were killed in Putumayo this summer, near the Colombian/Ecuador/Peru border. FARC pipeline attacks don't help an already difficult situation—increased oil production in Colombia has strained pipeline capacity. “As much as 100,000 barrels a day of oil production (bopd) could be shut in, I'm not exactly sure, but it means that you have to truck oil,” says Kozak. This means higher transportation costs, and companies can’t produce new discoveries at full throttle. In a negative market, that's deadly to a company’s share price. Colombia’s daily oil production currently exceeds 900,000 bopd, having risen more than 60 percent since 2006, but pipeline constraints have not allowed it to crack the magic 1 million bopd mark. Barriers to Progress Producers in Colombia are also experiencing long delays in permitting. Wells are not being drilled as fast as before, with companies being left waiting for up to a year without knowing when they’ll be able to drill. That has hurt exploration activities, and several of the leading Colombian juniors are now spending a big chunk of their exploration in Brazil, Ecuador and Peru—and sometimes even farther afield. Another factor, Kozak adds, is that the new discoveries in Colombia just aren’t coming as quickly as they did a couple years ago. “Colombia had great success at one point—but today look at Petrominerales and GranTierra Energy. PMG is now struggling while GTE is focused on developing discoveries. New discoveries are still limited,"" he said.[ More From Oilprice.com: GM Temporarily Halts Volt Production Over Low Sales ]Colombia reported that 34 percent of all wells were successful in the first half of 2012, compared with a 48 percent average from 2008-2010. Canadians formed a big portion of the foreigners who entered into the Colombian oil and gas sector in 2008-2009. I asked Kozak why that was, and he answered: “We in Canada are entrepreneurs. We have so many teams chasing so many opportunities, and recent success with our 'resource plays' here has been technology-related. Then guys say, hey, we can apply that somewhere else. We go apply our best practices and use our technology and turn things around.” The Canadians focused on the Llanos Basin, which looks geologically a lot like Alberta’s foothills (light oil) and the Putamayo in the south which is similar to Alberta’s plains (heavy oil). Colombia is one of a few countries in South America where you could go into the country and do business a lot like you would do in the west. The country is out of favor right now but Fred believes the question is when do you invest in the country, not if. “With $100 Brent oil, you have $60-$70 netbacks—you can make phenomenal money in that country, but there are short term issues"" Kozak said, adding that those short-term issues reflect growing pains, as the oil and gas sector continues to mature.“Success is responsible for the delays we’re seeing now—Colombia redefined its fiscal regime to attract new investment and kicked FARC out of most of country since President Uribe started his second term in 2006,"" he said.Recently, the army has increased its size and activity in the oil-producing regions, improving security. That may lead to an improved perception regarding security in 3-6 months. Permitting times have been slowly improving—the government is adding more people here as well. That should allow several companies to carry their plans of drilling high impact wells in the second half of 2012. Catalysts for Colombia's Junior Oil Companies A new pipeline starting in the first quarter of 2013 is expected to carry more than 490,000 bopd. As that new capacity becomes imminent, it could be a huge catalyst for Colombian juniors. An intriguing potential catalyst will happen sooner, however. The government has a new bid round in October for 115 blocks including 1/3rd for shale exploration in the Magdalena Basin. Says Kozak: “There have been a number of wells drilled that have seen shale but nothing like western Canada. Remember that the drilling density in this part of Colombia is a fraction of what North America is used to. Both Exxon and Shell are scheduled to drill a well each on Canacol farm-in lands, but depending on the bid round results in October, those results are not likely to be a 2012 catalyst.” Kozak concludes that addressing the country-specific risks will help (FARC, permitting delays, pipeline constraints) but the tide that would lift all boats requires the risk on trade to come back. But he says investors should not sit on their hands waiting for the tide to come in: “There’s going to be opportunity there especially through mergers & acquisition. These companies are very cheap. At these levels it’s almost cheaper to buy than to drill. The acquisition of PetroMagdalena by Pacific Rubiales being an example.” So how should investors approach investing in Colombian juniors?  “Remember it’s always about the people. When looking at companies to invest in, who are the people involved—and projects—how quickly can they take it to production,"" Kozak said.By Keith Schaefer —This story originally appeared on Oilprice.com.

291,How to rethink your retirement income strategy as more firms cut dividends,2020-05-04T17:58:29+0000,Sarah O'Brien,"The coronavirus-induced economic upheaval is taking a toll on a popular source of investment income for retirees: dividends.As U.S. companies deal with steep revenue drops and are forced to cut expenses, 203 stocks this year have reduced or suspended their dividends, 44 of them on the S&P 500 index. And, with economic uncertainty remaining going forward, that number could grow.""I definitely expect this to continue, unfortunately,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which keeps tabs on dividend actions by publicly traded common stock with a market capitalization of $25 million or more.","cnbc, Articles, Coronavirus: Personal Finance, Personal investing, Dividends, Retirement planning, Investment strategy, Personal finance, Personal saving, S&P 500 Index, Personal Finance, Investing, Retirement, Savings, Coronavirus, Companies, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","The coronavirus-induced economic upheaval is taking a toll on a popular source of investment income for retirees: dividends.As U.S. companies deal with steep revenue drops and are forced to cut expenses, 203 stocks this year have reduced or suspended their dividends, 44 of them on the S&P 500 index. And, with economic uncertainty remaining going forward, that number could grow.""I definitely expect this to continue, unfortunately,"" said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&P Dow Jones Indices, which keeps tabs on dividend actions by publicly traded common stock with a market capitalization of $25 million or more.Dividend-yielding stocks generally reward long-term investors, typically paying them quarterly from the company's profits. For retirees fearful of depleting their savings, this can offer a regular income stream without having to sell assets. While not all stocks have slashed dividends — at least 57 have increased them this year — relying solely on those payments for income may be missing the bigger picture.""Investors may have to shift their mindset about what it means to generate income from their portfolios,"" said certified financial planner Adam Reinert, chief investment officer with Marshall Financial Group in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.""If you think about what income means, is it really just dividends and [bond payments], or is it cash flow from the portfolio as a whole?"" he said.In other words, Reinert said, think of dividends, interest and growth of assets as the building blocks of an income stream. That way, he said, you can reduce some risk that comes with too heavy a focus on those income yields (payments as a share of the asset price).""If you just focus on dividends or coupon payments, you might see something with a higher yield, say 6%, but it could be riskier,"" Reinert said. ""Maybe the price is falling, or the dividend hasn't been adjusted yet.""Retirees also could use the bucket approach — using fixed-income investments, such as U.S. treasury bonds — to plan for income over a multi-year period. ""You effectively cover your living expenses for five or seven or 10 years by buying the appropriate fixed-income investments to match that time horizon,"" said CFP Michael Hennessy, founder and CEO of Harbor Crest Wealth Advisors in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ""Then, the remaining funds in your retirement account can be invested to capture long-term equity growth.""It also may be worthwhile upgrading your dividend stock holdings by replacing companies with weaker balance sheets — and more at risk of cutting dividends — with those whose financials suggest they are in better shape to continue paying, said Shon Anderson, a CFP and president of Anderson Financial Strategies in Dayton, Ohio. Some companies have consistently paid dividends for 25 years, or even 50 years or more, he said.""The company board of directors, and executive management, know that a growing dividend is extremely important to the majority of their shareholders and will protect it at all costs, even if it isn't necessarily the optimum short-term solution,"" Anderson said.More from Personal Finance:Here's how are unemployment benefits are taxedThis is what happens to your unpaid debt at deathCard issuers cutting credit limits without warningEven if a company cuts its dividend, they may resume or increase them once their finances are stronger.""They're likely to bring them back,"" Anderson said. ""But the reason they've had to reduce them is distress in their business, so it probably won't be in the near future.""Silverblatt, of S&P Dow Jones Indices, anticipates dividend cuts to be more prevalent among smaller and mid-sized public companies as the economy struggles to right itself.""I expect those companies to feel it the most,"" Silverblatt said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",12:01.6

He said that previously, the ratio of corn to soybean plantings were generally 50/50; now, most farmers are plotting a 75/25 ratio. The ramification for investors? Corn uses much more fertilizer, so look for those products' prices to rise, too -- and maybe a share boost for fertilizer makers like Bunge.But amid the euphoria, Williams is still the farm pragmatist: he and his peers are protecting themselves against market vagaries via futures and options planning.

This gap starts to widen more as employees go up the ladder.People outside the industry have often found these figures to be shocking, especially as the world economy is undergoing uncertainty and still reeling from the effects of the financial crisis of 2008. Banks are often criticized for big payouts and new rules on salary caps in Europe hasn't stopped that.""I think we are seeing some incentive systems in some corners of the financial sector, yet again, moving in the direction that I find not exactly aligned with the sense of purpose that I hope banks actually have,"" Christine Lagarde, the managing director of International Monetary Fund, said at a CNBC-moderated panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month. She also advised the financial sector to work with a sense of purpose and not ""single-mindedly"" for the pursuit of profits.European banks have to adhere to an EU-wide bonus cap that was put in practice in early 2014. The regulation limits bonuses paid to senior managers and other ""material risk takers"" to no more than 100 percent of their fixed pay generally, or 200 percent of their fixed pay with shareholders' approval.While this limit may have calmed an uproar over the large sums of money that executives take home, it has also led to banks increasing basic salaries as a way to compensate for the bonus restrictions.""One consequence of the regulation of remuneration, particularly the introduction in the EU of the bonus cap, has been an increase in fixed remuneration as a proportion of total remuneration,"" a Bank of England report published in December 2015 found.In 2015, the Bank of England and the Prudential Regulation Authority, also made changes around bonus buyouts, where banks compensate new employees for any remuneration foregone when they change jobs. As part of the new rules, banks can claw back some or all of the bonus already paid to an employee for up to seven years, if the employee is found to have committed wrongdoing in their previous job.The EU-wide bonus cap saw an impact not just on employee morale but also on hiring. Big European banks found it difficult to hire executives, especially when compared to U.S. banks where bonuses and fixed salaries can be higher.European banks are suffering from years of weak profits, massive fines, ultra-low monetary policy and uncertainty surrounding the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. The U.S. banks, on the other hand, especially the big ones like J.P. Morgan and Citi have very strong retail operations that have kept these banks resilient in the face of economic headwinds. This makes them better paymasters and a more conducive place to work.One recruitment consultant told CNBC, on condition of anonymity due to their relationship with large banks, that lenders like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan see strong bonus payouts for front of office roles executives — such as in the trading room — and were up to 30 to 40 percent better when compared to European banks such as Barclays, Deutsche Bank and UBS. Spokespersons for Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Deutsche Bank were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan and UBS declined to comment.""There is no comparison. A vice-president or a director level executive in a trading function at a U.S. bank will easily see a 100 percent cash bonus component as compared to a European bank where these are generally given as deferred, or in stocks,"" the consultant said.Banks pay out bonuses in various ways. While some banks, especially the U.S. banks, pay out a 100 percent cash bonus, several European banks pay out bonuses as a mix of cash and stocks. The cash component of the bonus, in many cases, is deferred and is paid out over a longer period — an incentive for the employee to stay with the company and a way for the institution to deal with costs.""I think that was the case three or four years ago, but we started to see the stronger European banks catch up last year to pay market levels,"" Joseph Leung, the founder and managing partner at recruitment firm Aubreck Leung, told CNBC last week.""Keep in mind many of them exited unprofitable businesses a few years ago and redistributed their capital to performing areas enabling them to pay their good people,"" Leung added.He, however, warned that this could change in 2019 since none of the European banks have announced their compensations yet.Amid all the uncertainty currently surrounding the banking sector, it is the new talent that is bearing the brunt. Young people joining banks often find themselves witnessing a massive income divide when compared with their senior peers who have climbed up the ladder pre-crisis and bonus-cap era.While some employees at European banks may feel disappointed with low pay and non-existent bonuses, others may feel comfortable with a steady flow of income — that is comparatively higher than what several other sectors pay.""Banks have been paying like this for years so don't think its affected morale in any way,"" Leung said.""Because of the bonus cap most people have seen their fixed compensation gone up — whether it's in a higher basic salary or in allowances ... So in a warped way some are actually getting more cash than they did before because they are getting less deferred stock.""",12:01.8

The site also has information on the firm's carbon footprint, which it reports as being 44.40 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent for the 2018 fiscal year.Amazon is just one of many global technology firms looking to power operations using renewable sources of energy. In March 2019, for example, Microsoft signed a 15-year power purchase agreement for the energy produced by a 74-megawatt solar power facility in North Carolina, while in April 2018 Apple announced its global facilities were powered using ""100 percent clean energy.""Making sure that its facilities are powered by clean energy is a multi-faceted process for Apple.In its Environmental Responsibility Report covering the 2018 fiscal year the California-headquartered firm said that, where feasible, it sourced renewable energy by building its own projects. In addition, it invests capital to become a part owner in wind and solar projects and signs ""long-term renewable energy contracts.""",12:02.5

But with nearly all trains on his line rerouted to Hoboken, New Jersey, he has had to piece together a makeshift plan to cross the Hudson River to Manhattan.""It's going to become an almost two-hour commute each way, on top of 10-hour work days,"" said Weinstock, a married father of two young children.With fewer platforms available, the repair work will complicate schedules for the three rail operators that use Penn Station: the national rail corporation Amtrak and the regional commuter train operators New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road.All three have canceled some routes into Penn, rerouted others and warned commuters to expect delays on remaining trains until all tracks are up and running again. The terminal serves 600,000 riders a day.Deb Wilson, 53, a human resources executive from Montclair, New Jersey, 15 miles west of Penn Station, said she is worried about the overflow of rerouted commuters in the small Hoboken terminal during the evening commute home from New York.""It's going to be mass pandemonium in Hoboken,"" Wilson said. ""They should have planned better. This is pretty dramatic.""Delays at Penn Station have become routine after a series of derailments, highlighting the urgency of the track repairs. The most recent incident occurred on Thursday evening when 180 people had to be rescued from a NJ Transit train that derailed as it emerged on the New York side of a tunnel under the Hudson River.New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Friday demanded a ""full investigation into all potential causes"" of the derailment.Deteriorating transit conditions have led to renewed criticism of Christie for canceling a new Hudson River rail tunnel project soon after taking office in 2010, saying the cost to his state was too high.Cuomo, touted as a potential Democratic challenger to President Donald Trump in 2020, has also come under pressure to fix New York's problem-plagued subways. As governor, he controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway system as well as LIRR and Metro-North, a commuter rail line serving the city's northern suburbs that use Grand Central Terminal.Still, the New York governor has no direct oversight over repairs at Penn Station, which is owned and operated by Amtrak.The national rail corporation is undertaking the massive repair program and rents track and station space to NJ Transit and the MTA's LIRR.Each railroad has devised separate contingency plans to work around the repairs, including reduced fares and alternate routes into New York.Amtrak CEO Charles Moorman told CNBC on Monday no one person is at fault for Penn Station's recurring infrastructure problems.Moorman, whose company took over Penn Station in the 1970s, said the transit hub went without major investments for a significant period of time and now it's time for an expedited update.""We like to think of it as the summer of renewal,""  Moorman said on ""Squawk Box."" ""The summer is generally a better time to this kind of work. Traffic patterns are down a little big because of vacation. And we just need to keep going and get this work done."" The CEO admitted that there had been an ongoing tension between Amtrak and New York's MTA. But the two groups have to coexist and work together, he said.""We have a good relationship with the Long Island Railroad and Metro North. ... A good working relationship at the operating level. I have a good working relationship with the MTA executive team,""  Moorman said.—CNBC's Berkeley Lovelace Jr. contributed to this report.",12:02.5

This is President Bush's top priority and there's no close second. Facing resistance from Congressional Democrats, Bush sought a momentum boost with his surprise visit to Iraq in advance of Gen. David Petraeus' testimony on the troop surge in Washington next week. Bush and even some Democrats see signs of military progress; Democratic leaders said the US military commitment isn't leading to political reconciliation that would allow troops to come home. --The new wild card: the economy. When you have a single issue stirring fear and anxiety among hedge fund markets, pension fund investors, and moderate-income homeowners, there's potential for a powerful political reaction. That's what the mortgage mess has produced. Bush responded last week with his limited assistance proposals, while Democrats want more -- including potential cash bailouts.

Republicans bruised by the unpopularity of Iraq and scandal drama (see: Craig, Larry) are spoiling to battle Democrats over one of their familiar themes.

But only 2.5 percent of South African students were enrolled in private schools, as of 2007.Founded in 1872, Hilton College (pictured) is South Africa’s most expensive private boarding school. Located in the eastern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands, the school has about 400 students and sits on a 17 square-kilometer property.Hilton is part of a group of private South African schools referred to as the ""Elite 7."" Schools in the group include Diocesan College, Michaelhouse, St. Stithians College, St. Andrews College, Kearseny College, and St. John’s College.The average annual boarding fee is around $20,000 for most of these schools. A strong emphasis is placed on sports competition among the schools, with Hilton’s website listing over 15 different sports programs.Most Expensive: Yew Chung International School of ShanghaiAnnual Tuition: $34,407*Students in Private School: NAThe business of international schooling in China is booming. The country’s private education market is expected to grow to nearly $80 billion by 2012 from $60 billion in 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The World Bank says the number of private schools in China rose 134 percent from 29,964 to 70,256 between 1997 and 2003. Over the same period, the number of private school students increased 273 percent to 14.16 million, but that’s still just a tiny fraction of the population.Yew Chung International School (YCIS) in Shanghai is the most expensive school in China. The day school has four campuses with two dedicated to junior schools. The Hong Kong based organization with 5,000 students also has schools in Beijing, Chongqing, Qingdao and Silicon Valley, California.Beijing and Shanghai have nearly half a dozen international schools that charge over $30,000 in annual tuition fees.

That compares to a loss of about $6,000 for blacks and $10,000 for Hispanics. Yet because whites' and Asians' net-worths are higher, their percentage losses were lower.What accounts for this widening wealth-race gap?The main contributor is home ownership and wealth portfolios. Historically speaking, homes make up a larger share of wealth for black and Hispanics.  Whites have a greater share of wealth in other assets, like stocks, mutual funds and other financial instruments.Because financial assets have recovered from the recession more strongly than home prices, wealth for whites also recovered more rapidly.Blacks and Hispanics have also suffered from higher unemployment than whites. The unemployment rate for whites is around 7.4 percent; it’s nearly twice that level for blacks.Just to be clear, the study doesn’t show that race is a cause of these disparities. But it is clear that in strict economic terms, the wealth gap in America is growing between the races.Do you think there are other reasons that the wealth gap between races is growing?-By CNBC's Robert FrankFollow Robert Frank on Twitter: @robtfrank",12:03.9

312,China’s tech giants are pouring billions into US start-ups,2017-03-09T13:53:00+0000,,"Joe Chen, CEO of Chinese social networking service Renren, first met SoFi CEO Mike Cagney in Palo Alto in 2011 and, over coffee, decided to invest in the fast-growth, disruptive online finance start-up. That initial $4 million investment helped SoFi get its start and led to two more financings within three years, with Renren contributing a major chunk of some $230 million raised.Fast-forward, and SoFi last month topped it off with a $500 million investment from private-equity powerhouse Silver Lake.","cnbc, Articles, Jack Ma, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Investment strategy, World Markets, Investing, Global Investing Hot Spots, Special Reports, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Joe Chen, CEO of Chinese social networking service Renren, first met SoFi CEO Mike Cagney in Palo Alto in 2011 and, over coffee, decided to invest in the fast-growth, disruptive online finance start-up. That initial $4 million investment helped SoFi get its start and led to two more financings within three years, with Renren contributing a major chunk of some $230 million raised.Fast-forward, and SoFi last month topped it off with a $500 million investment from private-equity powerhouse Silver Lake.SoFi is just the kind of deal that Chen has been pursuing: His NYSE-listed company, once known as the Facebook of China, has been investing in  to broaden its revenues and boost its stock price. That connection with Renren has also boosted SoFi.""Joe is a great investor and was our investor from the early days. He saw the vision early on and pushed us to grow faster and be more aggressive,"" said Dan Macklin, a co-founder of SoFi in San Francisco.Similarly to Renren, China's tech titans Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are leading a surge of Chinese investment in cutting-edge U.S. technology start-ups with bold ambitions to expand their footprint, attract top talent and gain an edge in innovation.Collectively known as the BAT, China's giant technology companies that dominate search, e-commerce and mobile messaging in their home market are going global. The United States is their primary shopping place to diversify and build out their brands. The hunt is on to acquire or buy into fast-growing young companies in a broad range of the hottest tech sectors, such as virtual reality, fintech, social media, video games and mobile apps. Their deals include such well-known American brands as image messaging app Snap, ride-sharing service Lyft and virtual reality player Magic Leap.China's four largest internet companies — the BAT plus e-commerce company JD.com — have invested $5.6 billion in 48 U.S. tech deals over the past two years, according to CBI Insights data. California took in more than three-quarters of the total U.S.-based deals by these four companies, with Silicon Valley a popular hunting ground.Overall, Chinese investment in the U.S. economy has soared, with such high-profile deals as China's Anbang Insurance purchase of the landmark Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City for $1.95 billion.Last year Chinese investors put a record $45.6 billion in U.S. companies, triple the amount for 2015, according to research group Rhodium Group in New York City. The momentum has picked up as the Chinese economy has slowed and as the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the Chinese yen, points out Rhodium economist Thilo Hanemann.""The Chinese government is spending billions of dollars literally trying to level the playing field a bit"" between the United States and China in technology, said Orville Schell, director of U.S.-China relations for the Asia Society, which released a 2014 report on China high-tech investments in the United States.This flurry of deal making comes against a recent crackdown by Chinese authorities to tighten restrictions on capital outflows and control ""irrational"" outbound investment by Chinese firms. Such restrictions are threatening completion of a $1 billion purchase by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group of Dick Clark Productions in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, U.S. alarms about potential security and economic risks over Chinese takeovers of American companies have been heightened during the recent presidential election.For the founders of U.S. tech start-ups, getting cozy with Chinese acquirers and investors can make good business sense. With a Chinese investor, their business gains a competitive edge in the exceedingly difficult-to-penetrate China market. Getting funds from China's leading tech companies can help U.S. companies gain an entry point to China, an immediate on-the-ground presence and strategic insights such as how to best customize products for the local Chinese market.More from Global Investing Hot Spots:  The billionaire who is saving Bethlehem with the support of a Saudi Prince   Trump's ban on immigration has an unexpected beneficiary: Canadian start-ups   An anti-Buffett investing bet that's suddenly busting out Moreover, founders of U.S. tech start-ups can get favorable terms from the Chinese corporate investors, which are known to pay more to invest in American start-ups compared with Sand Hill Road venture capitalists. The Chinese buyers are in effect ""paying a tuition"" to get insights into the U.S. market, points out Jay Eum, co-founder and managing director of TransLink Capital in Silicon Valley.China's e-commerce leader, Alibaba, by the visionary Jack Ma, has been particularly active in investing in U.S. start-ups. In recent years Alibaba has led a $793 million financing round in virtual reality start-up Magic Leap, $200 million in social media company Snap, $215 million in mobile messaging app Tango, $250 million in ride-sharing app Lyft, $50 million in remote-control app Peel, $120 million in mobile gaming start-up Kabam in July, $50 million in app search engine Quixey and $206 million in subscription service ShopRunner.Not to be outdone, Baidu has invested $30 million in mobile safety firm TrustGo and $10 million in mapping company Indoor Atlas. Meanwhile, Tencent invested $400 million in game developer Riot Games and another $400 million in Epic Games, in addition to co-investing with Alibaba in Lyft. Besides its groundbreaking investment in SoFi, Renren has invested in a series of U.S. fintech start-ups, leading a $31 million lead investment in crowdfunding real estate site Fundrise in 2014 and leading a $40 million investment in U.S.-based stock-trading outfit Motif in 2015.The China deals typically are for a minority investment stake rather than a controlling interest —in part a strategy to minimize risk while still getting an angle of U.S. tech. Taking a long-term perspective, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have all established offices in California for research and development and for corporate venture investing. This type of China tech deal making is a long way from the pattern of Japanese deal makers during the 1990s in the United States, when investment from Japan poured into trophy properties such as Pebble Beach and Rockefeller Center and later suffered major losses.The Chinese deal makers in U.S. tech companies are active, not passive, investors. Silicon Valley-based messaging app Tango, which snared a $215 million investment by Alibaba in 2014, holds monthly meetings with a board member at Alibaba to review strategies and strategic impact, says Tango CEO and co-founder Eric Setton. He frequently visits Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou and has set up a Beijing office. Setton said he got his initial introduction to Alibaba from Jerry Yang, a founder of Yahoo, which has been strongly linked through ownership ties with the Chinese conglomerate for several years.Another Silicon Valley start-up, Peel, has experienced a similar tight interaction with its Chinese investors, which include Alibaba. Co-founder Thiru Arunachalam said he gets access to talent in China through the Alibaba connection and gains leverage in the fast-growing Chinese market.Venture investor Eum of Translink, which has seen three of its portfolio companies (Peel, Tango and Quixey) get invested in by Alibaba, said he has been ""super impressed"" by Alibaba as a strategic investor. He pointed to a synergistic relationship and solid informational interchange as key advantages for both the China and U.S. sides.— By Rebecca Fannin, special to CNBC.com",12:04.3

Chinese officials say their country faces a growing threat from  militants and separatists, especially in its unruly Western  region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have died in violence in the  past few years.  The law has attracted deep concern in Western capitals, not only  because of worries it could violate human rights such as freedom  of speech, but because of the cyber provisions. U.S. President  Barack Obama has said that he had raised concerns about the law  directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.","cnbc, Articles, Politics, Asia News, China, Wars and Military Conflicts, White House, Terrorism, source:tagname:Reuters","China's parliament passed a controversial new anti-terrorism law  on Sunday that requires technology firms to hand over sensitive  information such as encryption keys to the government and allows  the military to venture overseas on counter-terror operations.  Chinese officials say their country faces a growing threat from  militants and separatists, especially in its unruly Western  region of Xinjiang, where hundreds have died in violence in the  past few years.  The law has attracted deep concern in Western capitals, not only  because of worries it could violate human rights such as freedom  of speech, but because of the cyber provisions. U.S. President  Barack Obama has said that he had raised concerns about the law  directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  Speaking after China's largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the  law, Li Shouwei, deputy head of the parliament's criminal law  division under the legislative affairs committee, said China was  simply doing what other Western nations already do in asking  technology firms to help fight terror.  ""This rule accords with the actual work need of fighting  terrorism and is basically the same as what other major countries  in the world do,"" Li told reporters.  This will not affect the normal operation of tech companies and  they have nothing to fear in terms of having ""backdoors""  installed or losing intellectual property rights, he added.  Officials in Washington have argued the law, combined with new  draft banking and insurance rules and a slew of anti-trust  investigations, amounts to unfair regulatory pressure targeting  foreign companies.  China's national security law adopted in July requires all key  network infrastructure and information systems to be ""secure and  controllable"".  The anti-terrorism law also permits the People's Liberation Army  to get involved in anti-terrorism operations overseas, though  experts have said China faces big practical and diplomatic  problems if it ever wants to do this.  An Weixing, head of the Public Security Ministry's  counter-terrorism division, said China faced a serious threat  from terrorists, especially ""East Turkestan"" forces, China's  general term for Islamists separatists it says operate in  Xinjiang.  ""Terrorism is the public enemy of mankind, and the Chinese  government will oppose all forms of terrorism,"" An said.  Rights groups, though, doubt the existence of a cohesive militant  group in Xinjiang and say the unrest mostly stems from anger  among the region's Muslim Uighur people over restrictions on  their religion and culture.  The new law also restricts the right of media to report on  details of terror attacks, including a provision that media and  social media cannot report on details of terror activities that  might lead to imitation, nor show scenes that are ""cruel and  inhuman"".",12:04.6

""But I do think  there's a lot of turmoil in the Middle East, and you certainly  have the Saudis—who dislike the Iranians—upset about  the fact there could be a thawing relationship between the U.S.  and Iran. ... The Saudis have been showing their displeasure for  some time.""  Lipow said the U.S. will continue to be an important market to  Saudi Arabia, which owns 50 percent of the Motiva refinery in  Texas in a joint venture with Shell.   ""They just finished spending $10 billion in Port Arthur on the  expansion,"" he said.  Iran's new president Hassam Rouhani has been on a  ""charm offensive,"" since visiting the U.N. last month.  He  received a historic phone call from President Barack Obama as he  was leaving New York, breaking 30 years of silence between leaders  of the two countries.   Rouhani has said Iran has no intention of developing  nuclear weapons. Analysts do not expect sanctions to be lifted any  time soon, even if there is progress in the talks. But Reuters  reported Tuesday that Iran is already reaching out to its old oil  buyers and is talking price cuts if sanctions are lifted.   As for Syria, the Obama Administration was adamant about making  the regime there accountable for the deaths of civilians from a  gas attack. The U.S. prepared to bomb the country but reversed  course at the last minute and the UN has now taken the lead. Saudi Arabia had been lobbying for the temporary seat on the  Security Council, so it was surprising when the kingdom turned it  down, citing the council's ineffectiveness in dealing with Syria  and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   Brent crude, reflecting the international oil price, ticked  slightly higher on the report but slipped back. West Texas  Intermediate, on the other hand, was sharply lower after delayed  U.S. inventory data showed a supply buildup in domestic crude.  WTI futures fell below their 200-day moving average of  $98.60 for the first time since June. The futures, scheduled to  expire at the close of business Tuesday, dipped $1.42 to close at  $97.80.   The December contract was trading just above $98. ""It looks the  same ... very bearish on a technical basis,"" Kilduff said of  the December contract. ""The U.S. refining industry has slowed  from its summer peak, and that's allowing the crude oil  inventories to really replenish and build back up, given the  surge in shale production.""  The Saudis have been instrumental in the West's embargo on Iranian oil. Iran is being sanctioned for its nuclear program,  which it says is not for weapons use. An improvement in U.S.-Iran relations would return more than 1 million barrels a day to  the world market.  ""They really don't want that Iranian oil back on the market,""  said Tradition Energy analyst Gene McGillian. It may be  that the Saudis withdrew from the Security Council because  they are more comfortable working behind the scenes, he added.   The Saudis have been producing record amounts of oil to  make up the for the shortfall from Iran. Saudi output is over 10 million barrels a day. The U.S. has supplanted Russia this year as the world's largest producer of both  oil and gas, but in oil production the  Saudis remain at the top.  The U.S. produced 7.4 million barrels a day in the week ended  Oct. 11, down from 7.8 million barrels the week earlier.  Saudi Arabia exported an average of 1.4 million barrels a day  of total petroleum liquids to the United States last year, up  from 1.2 million in 2011. That represented 16 percent of U.S.  crude imports and was second only to those from Canada.  (Read more: Three possible winners from Kenya's oil  explosion)  U.S. oil inventory data for last week is expected to be reported  Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. ET, and McGillian expects to see another  build of 3 million barrels. He was skeptical that the Saudi  reports affected oil markets.  ""I don't think it really spilled over into the oil market,"" he  said. ""There are reports the Saudis are going to try to increase  their production to put pressure on Iran but they do that  anyway.""  McGillian said there's plenty of reasons for U.S. oil to remain  depressed, and the spread is widening dramatically with Brent. ""We pumped nearly 19 million barrels back into storage in the  United States in the last four weeks,"" he said, ""and you haven't seen a  pickup in demand."" —By CNBC's Patti Domm.

320,Bank of America to Boost Stake in China's CCB,2008-05-27T23:10:21+0000,,"Bank of America said on Tuesday it would exercise part of an option to buy shares of China Construction Bank, investing HK$14.52 billion (US$1.86 billion) and raising its stake in China's second-largest bank to 10.75 percent.","cnbc, Articles, Bank of America Corp, Companies, source:tagname:Reuters","Bank of America said on Tuesday it would exercise part of an option to buy shares of China Construction Bank, investing HK$14.52 billion (US$1.86 billion) and raising its stake in China's second-largest bank to 10.75 percent. Bank of America, the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets, said it intended to buy 6 billion of CCB's Hong Kong-listed shares around June 5 for about HK$2.42 each under a formula set when it first agreed to buy a 9 percent stake in CCB investment in June 2005 for US$3 billion. With CCB shares closing at HK$6.65 in Tuesday trading, Bank of America is getting the stake at a 64 percent discount. The new shares are currently worth about HK$39.9 billion (US$5.11 billion), offering some good news for a U.S. retail banking giant that has been hit by rising consumer credit losses and a weakening economy. Bank of America earlier this year raised more than $12 billion to boost capital required by bank regulators. Some analysts have forecast that BofA will cut its dividend in the second half. The investment in one of the world's hottest markets has paid off handsomely for the North Carolina bank. CCB stock has surged 83 percent since the bank's October 2005 IPO. After the latest transaction, Bank of America said it would hold about 25.1 billion shares, which means US$4.86 billion of investments by the bank currently have a paper value of US$21.4 billion. Bank of America spokesman Bob Stickler said the bank would not record any gain from the transaction because the new shares cannot be sold until August 2011 without CCB's consent. The shares will be carried at cost.     Shares For Sale? Last month, several press reports said BofA was looking to shed part of its CCB stake to raise capital needed to cope with a weakening U.S. economy. BofA is also preparing to take over Countrywide Financial , the largest U.S. home lender slammed by the mortgage slump. Stickler declined to comment on speculation that BofA was considering selling CCB shares, though the latest transaction will likely do nothing to end the market talk. ""We've been in talks with the Chinese government for a number of months. Anything we do is in consultation with them"" and with the management of CCB, Stickler said. The shares acquired in 2005 have a three-year lock-up that expires October 2008. By exercising the call option now, BofA ""starts the clock"" and increases its flexibility to sell the new shares down the road, Stickler said. Bank of America had talks with CCB and SAFE Investment (Huijin), the Chinese government body that controls CCB, about exercising a portion of its call option. BofA will purchase its new shares from Huijin. Under the 2005 stock purchase agreement, BofA can increase its stake to just under 20 percent. CCB currently has a market value of nearly US$200 billion, or one-fourth more than that of BofA. Last month BofA Chief Financial Officer Joe Price told Reuters the bank would likely raise its stake first before considering any share sales. Bank of America  shares were unchanged at $33.94 on the New York Stock Exchange early Tuesday afternoon.",12:05.6

328,Fall of CEO O'Neal Was As Rapid As His Rise,2007-10-29T20:28:20+0000,,The anticipated departure of Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal would mark a surprising flameout in a career that had been impressive in its ascent.,"cnbc, Articles, NYSE Euronext, BlackRock Inc, Business News, Finance, Banks, Financials, source:tagname:Reuters","The anticipated departure of Merrill Lynch Chief Executive Stan O'Neal would mark a surprising flameout in a career that had been impressive in its ascent.The first African-American to run a major Wall Street firm, O'Neal appears to have lost his grip on the top job after misjudging subprime mortgage risk and presiding over the biggest quarterly loss in the brokerage's 93-year history.O'Neal, 56, who is also Merrill's chairman, was expected to step down, possibly on Monday, from board pressure in what would make him the highest-ranking casualty in the U.S.subprime mortgage crisis.Named CEO in 2002, O'Neal pushed the world's largest brokerage into new businesses, expanding its revenue base outside the United States. But he looked set to lose his job less than a week after the company wrote down $8.4 billion in the third quarter, mostly on bad bets tied to risky subprime loans and related securities.The write-down, announced on Wednesday, triggered a $2.3 billion quarterly loss, or several times bigger than what O'Neal initially warned investors about earlier his month.   Two Decades at FirmIn 1986, Merrill Lynch recognized O'Neal's star quality and plucked him from the ranks of the treasury office at General Motors, where his father was a factory worker.O'Neal earned his stripes on the assembly line, too, alternating between the factory and the classroom to earn his degree. GM later paid for him to go to Harvard Business School.Merrill Lynch put O'Neal in the firm's high-yield business. From there, he eventually became chief financial officer and, in 2000, president of the bread-and-butter private client business, where he oversaw an army of brokers and later became a cost cutter during lean times in the stock market.Under O'Neal's leadership, Merrill Lynch devoted considerable energy to diversifying its businesses and expanding overseas. When Goldman Sachs Group began raking in money by taking more proprietary risk, Merrill Lynch tried doing the same.As recently as a month ago, O'Neal's hold on the company looked solid. Merrill Lynch seemed mostly removed from the subprime turmoil that buckled two hedge funds at Bear StearnsCos Inc this past summer and led to the ouster of Co-President Warren Spector.Past and current executives at Merrill say O'Neal could be autocratic at times and relied heavily on industry benchmarks -- such as comparing Merrill to Goldman Sachs -- to map out thecompany's strategy.Subprime StumbleThrough the second quarter, profit had quintupled, increasing at a compound annual rate of more than 40 percent since O'Neal took over Merrill Lynch. Since he became chairman, the company has had four consecutive years of record net earnings. He received about $48 million last year for his work.But Merrill stumbled by paying $1.3 billion in December for subprime lender First Franklin Financial. The timing and price of the acquisition puzzled Wall Street because defaults on risky subprime loans already were escalating and demand for pools of these loans packaged into securities was drying up.Merrill Lynch's position as the leading underwriter of collateralized debt obligations -- complex securities that repackaged risk from mortgages and other collateral -- also presented considerable risk because they were tied to subprime loans, too.On Oct. 5, O'Neal shocked Wall Street when he said the company would take $5.5 billion in write-downs and post a quarterly loss, its first in six years.But what really shook investors' confidence in O'Neal was that the write-down figure had mushroomed by nearly $3 billion by the time the company officially reported results last week.   From Farm to BoardroomBorn in 1951 in the segregated South, O'Neal picked corn and cotton on his grandfather's farm in Wedowee, Alabama.He was born in Roanoke, Alabama, because the hospital in Wedowee did not serve African-American families, O'Neal said years later in a 2001 profile for the Harvard Business SchoolBulletin.Prospects for O'Neal's family brightened when they moved to Atlanta and his father landed a job at GM.In 2002, Merrill Chief Executive David Komansky, a wisecracking Bronx native and Merrill Lynch lifer, tapped O'Neal, who had proven his mettle by cutting nearly 2,000 jobs in the brokerage group, as his replacement. It was a critical time for the company, as weak stock markets hurt the brokerage and investment banking business.O'Neal did not return messages left at his home and office.But last week, he accepted blame for the quarterly loss during a tense conference with analysts, investors and reporters.""The bottom line is, we got it wrong by being overexposed to subprime,"" O'Neal said. ""And we suffered as a result of an unprecedented liquidity squeeze and deterioration in that market. No one, no one is more disappointed than I am in that result.""",12:06.5
329,The gadgets and software that could help us return to the office,2020-08-03T06:12:49+0000,Ryan Browne,"As employers around the world figure out how best to return workers to the office, tech companies are hoping that gadgets and software could help the process.The coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns have left offices around the world empty.

And while there's been lots of talk about the benefits of flexible working, there are still some workers who want to experience life in the office again.But to do that, companies need to make sure they have strict health and safety regimes in place. Tech firms big and small have been developing everything from wearable devices to thermal imaging cameras to help businesses equip their office spaces for the future.Tharsus, a U.K.-based robotics group, is mostly known for designing robotics and automation systems for firms like online retailer Ocado and telecommunications firm BT. In response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the firm developed wearables for workers to wear around their necks to help with distancing themselves from colleagues.The hardware — which looks like a futuristic smart necklace — sends out alerts to wearers every time they come into close proximity with another worker. Tharsus is looking to roll the technology out in a number of workplace environments, including offices, warehouses and canteens.The tech is currently being trialed at the Manufacturing Technology Centre, an independent research institute based in Coventry, England. The facility houses manufacturing titans such as Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Siemens and General Motors.""Bump is like traffic lights, which improve safety and at the same time improve capacity,"" Tharsus CEO Brian Palmer told CNBC. ""Analysis of Bump traffic data enables the volume of people in the workplace to increase, safely.""It's somewhat evocative of contact-tracing apps, another tool that companies — and governments — have been considering as part of their reopening plans. These apps rely on Bluetooth or location data to notify users if they may have been exposed to the virus.Consulting giant PwC, for instance, developed an app for corporate clients to track employees who come into close contact and alert human resources staff if they may be at risk of coming down with the virus. The app has been tested in the company's Shanghai office.However, contact-tracing apps have faced criticism from privacy advocates concerned they could be too invasive. Officials and experts have also said the apps deployed so far haven't yet been a ""game changer"" in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.While different from contact tracing, Tharsus' solution is similar in that it aims to measure proximity. Bump relies on radio frequencies to send out signals to users if they get too close to each other. As far as privacy is concerned, Palmer said the tech was compliant with EU privacy laws and that data wouldn't be shared with third parties.""We designed Bump with this in mind and to ensure wearers don't need to sacrifice data privacy,"" he said. ""All data is available to an individual business and their team members alike. Everyone can see who collected data, when and why.""""Other app-based solutions only notify users if social distancing fails 'after the event' i.e. after they have been exposed to risk,"" he said. ""Bump provides real-time protection from the risk in the first place.""Meanwhile, thermal imaging cameras have also been suggested as a potential way of helping bring staff back to the office. The cameras use infrared technology to detect radiating heat from a person and then estimate their body temperature.British telecommunications firm Vodafone is deploying heat detection cameras made by surveillance tech maker Digital Barriers. The cameras are currently in use at the training ground of English rugby club Wasps, however Vodafone said they will also be used in offices, typically by an entrance or reception area.""The device uses both thermal and HD cameras to deliver reliable, real-time body temperature screening accurate to within +/- 0.3 degrees Celsius and can screen up to 100 people every minute,"" said Anne Sheehan, director of Vodafone Business U.K.Responding to concerns over whether the cameras could infringe workers' privacy, Vodafone said its cameras are a ""temperature screening solution only.""""The data it gathers is only relevant at that particular point in time,"" said Sheehan. ""The device doesn't include technologies such as facial recognition and it cannot be used as a tracking device.""But like much tech being proposed to return life to some level of normality, health officials have cast doubt on the use of thermal cameras in trying to screen people for potential virus cases. The World Health Organization for instance has said temperature screening alone ""may not be very effective.""And while some tech companies are figuring out ways of detecting symptoms and regulating exposure to the virus, others are seeking to eradicate it.Take ultraviolet lights, which have previously been used to kill bacteria, for instance. Some firms, such as Dutch lighting maker Signify, are hoping the technology can be applied to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.The World Health Organization has warned people not to use UV lights on their skin due to the dangerous levels of radiation that they emit. But Signify aims to use the lights to disinfect surfaces in offices and other settings like schools and restrooms.And science may be on the company's side. Signify tested its own UV lights with researchers at Boston University, who found that exposure of the virus to UV light helps eradicate it. Signify is now ramping up production of the lights.One trend the pandemic has accelerated is the use of software to communicate and collaborate remotely. Platforms like Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen a surge in demand with entire workforces forced to adapt to telecommuting. Cisco's Webex video-conferencing app saw a record 324 million users attend virtual meetings in March.""There's been a seismic change in the last few months in terms of working,"" Chintan Patel, Cisco's chief technologist in the U.K., told CNBC. ""It goes without saying that what's taken place has been incredible.""The question for these platforms is whether they can continue this momentum as shelter-in-place measures ease and businesses start to reopen. Executives said there would be a continued need for such services as businesses adopt a ""hybrid"" approach of keeping staff at home while some employees return to the office.Patel said touchless technology such as voice-activated intelligent assistants could help with holding virtual meetings from the office. Cisco's video technology is also capable of measuring how many people are in a meeting, he said, adding this was compliant with EU privacy laws.Still, it could be some time before a majority of office workers are back in the office. Many large tech companies are now offering workers greater flexibility over their working situations due to Covid-19 — Twitter has gone so far as to let employees work from home ""forever.""According to a YouGov study commissioned by identity management software firm Okta, just 29% of European workers surveyed between April and May wanted to go back to the office full-time. That figure fell to as low as 24% in Britain.Meanwhile, 55% of workers felt they were equipped with the necessary hardware for working at home, while 56% said they had the appropriate software. YouGov surveyed over 6,000 people across the U.K., Germany, France and the Netherlands.""If you really have to bring everyone to a meeting together, something extraordinary will have to happen,"" Julien Codorniou, vice president of Facebook's Workplace app — a rival to Slack and Teams — told CNBC. ""I hope the office will be a place for more meaningful interactions.""Finally, there's the issue of how workers will get to the office. It's easy to see why many people in big cities like London and New York might be anxious about the idea of taking public transport, potentially being packed in like sardines on a busy bus or subway. And driving in such areas can be far from ideal.Several start-ups are hoping to convince authorities and consumers that two-wheel electric vehicles like scooters and bikes might be able to solve this problem. In the U.K. that's particularly relevant, since the government has recently made it legal to ride e-scooters on roads. A number of trials are getting underway across the country. New York City has also approved the private use of e-scooters and bikes, and will allow e-scooter operators to apply for permits in the city, with the exception of Manhattan.It is hoped the devices will offer a safer and more environmentally-friendly alternative for people commuting to the office.""This is about getting the public back to work moving again in a safe way,"" Richard Corbett, the U.K. general manager at Swedish e-scooter firm Voi, told CNBC.""Authorities are using the current opportunity as an opportunity for challenge,"" said Per Brilioth, CEO of VNV Global, an investor in Voi.""That's been the ongoing trend, to reduce — not take away completely — but reduce the need for cars and fossil fuel for transportation into something that's cleaner in every aspect.""",12:06.6

331,Kraft is taking the CFTC to court keep the lid on a $16 million fine in market manipulation case,2019-08-22T12:51:36+0000,Jesse Pound,"Kraft and Mondelez are taking the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to court in a bid to keep the agency from discussing a $16 million fine to settle allegations of manipulating the wheat markets.The two food companies agreed to pay the fine as part of a deal with the CFTC that the companies say restricted what regulators could say about the case. Kraft and Mondelez, which was created when Kraft split into two companies in 2012, are now suing the CFTC for contempt. They filed a motion in federal court in Chicago on Friday, saying the regulator violated the order in an Aug. 15 press release announcing the deal.""The CFTC and its Commissioners engaged in a deliberate, orchestrated effort to violate the Court's Consent Order within minutes of its entry,"" the companies said in the filing. The two sides face off in court Sept. 12, according to court documents.According to the CFTC, Kraft intentionally drove down the price of wheat in 2011 by buying an excessive amount of futures contracts on the grain.Food companies have made such moves to hedge fluctuations in commodities prices by agreeing to pay a specific price at a specific date in the future. Unlike a hedge fund or trading firm, companies like Kraft are limited in their futures purchases and are prohibited from speculating.Kraft was allowed to have a futures position of roughly 3 million bushels of wheat, the CFTC said in the original complaint. Instead, Kraft allegedly bought futures contracts for 15.75 million bushels, worth more than $93 million.The consent order included a clause that read ""neither party shall make any public statement about this case other than to refer to the terms of this settlement agreement or public documents filed in this case.""The order also prohibited the CFTC from saying whether either defendant violated federal law.After the agreement, the CFTC issued a press release on Aug. 15 saying the penalty was ""valued at three times the alleged gain"" and included statements from Chairman Heath P. Tarbert and links to statements from individual commissioners.""Market manipulation inflicts real pain on farmers by denying them the fair value of their hard work and crops,"" Tarbert said in his statement. ""It also hurts American families by raising the costs of putting food on the table. Instances of market manipulation are precisely the kinds of cases the CFTC was founded to pursue.""The CFTC told the court Saturday that its public statements didn't violate the order and that its individual commissioners were not bound by the agreement. The CFTC voluntarily removed the announcement from its website until the next court appearance.The CFTC and Kraft declined to comment for this article. Mondelez did not respond to a request for comment.The segments of Kraft and Mondelez named as defendants in the case were part of the same company in 2011 when the trades took place. In 2012, Kraft Foods changed its name to Mondelez and spun off Kraft Foods Group Inc., which merged with Heinz in 2015 to form the Kraft Heinz Co.Kraft's futures position in 2011 represented 87% of the active futures market for that particular month and type of wheat, according to the CFTC. The agency accused the company of taking this position to try to lower the price of wheat in the spot market where it was buying the grain.With Kraft signaling to the market that it intended to change its normal plan and buy wheat through the futures market instead of the spot market, the price of wheat in the futures market rose and the cash price fell, allowing Kraft to reap a profit, according to the complaint.When the company bought wheat in the spot market and unwound a large portion of its futures position, it generated a gain of more than $5 million, according to the CFTC.Some companies are allowed to file for exemptions to the caps on futures positions for hedging purposes. The CFTC said Kraft did not have an exemption and that its futures position represented a six-month supply of the wheat it needed at its Toledo area-flour mill and was not for legitimate business purposes.The regulator also said Kraft performed illegal offsetting trades of futures contracts with itself.Kraft has been one of the worst-performing large cap stocks in 2019, shedding more than 40% of its share price this year. The stock of Mondelez International, the parent company of the defendant in this suit, is up more than 35% this year.Clarification: The headline of this article was changed to clarify that Kraft hasn't filed a new lawsuit against the CFTC.

The agency accused the company of taking this position to try to lower the price of wheat in the spot market where it was buying the grain.With Kraft signaling to the market that it intended to change its normal plan and buy wheat through the futures market instead of the spot market, the price of wheat in the futures market rose and the cash price fell, allowing Kraft to reap a profit, according to the complaint.When the company bought wheat in the spot market and unwound a large portion of its futures position, it generated a gain of more than $5 million, according to the CFTC.Some companies are allowed to file for exemptions to the caps on futures positions for hedging purposes. The CFTC said Kraft did not have an exemption and that its futures position represented a six-month supply of the wheat it needed at its Toledo area-flour mill and was not for legitimate business purposes.The regulator also said Kraft performed illegal offsetting trades of futures contracts with itself.Kraft has been one of the worst-performing large cap stocks in 2019, shedding more than 40% of its share price this year. The stock of Mondelez International, the parent company of the defendant in this suit, is up more than 35% this year.Clarification: The headline of this article was changed to clarify that Kraft hasn't filed a new lawsuit against the CFTC. The company filed a contempt motion in an already existing lawsuit by the agency.",12:06.7

Only 17 countries now recognize Taiwan.China and Taiwan have fought a tug-of-war for diplomatic recognition in the South Pacific for decades, with some island nations switching allegiances for financial gain.John Moffat Fugui, a Solomons' parliamentarian and head of a taskforce charged with evaluating diplomatic ties, said on Wednesday that Beijing would pay into a fund even though it usually preferred ""grants, concessionary loans and sometimes gifts"".""But for you, we will give you a 1/8Rural Constituency Development Fund 3/8 for a certain period,"" Fugui said, referring to recent negotiations with Beijing officials.Fugui said the offer would help fill an immediate gap should the Solomons cut ties with Taiwan that date back to 1983.Taiwan has pledged $8.5 million to the Solomons in 2019-20 through a fund, budget documents show.The Solomons, an archipelago of just over 600,000 people, relies heavily on such payments due to its limited means of generating income, which is largely through timber exports.The South Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where formal ties with six of the 16 island nations make up more than a third of its total alliances.A report by the Australia-based Lowy Institute think-tank last month said: ""Both Australia and the U.S. are concerned about whether Solomon Islands chooses to switch recognition from Taiwan to China"".

""This is the first of many"" trade actions, the president said. The new measures will primarily target certain products in the technology sector where Beijing holds an advantage over Washington.That followed Trump's executive order earlier this month that imposed broad duties on foreign aluminum and steel imports — an action that many said could trigger a global trade war.—Reuters contributed to this report.",12:07.4

338,Former employees file class action against Wells Fargo,2016-09-25T08:07:18+0000,,"Two former Wells Fargo  employees have filed  a class action in California seeking $2.6 billion or more for  workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without  engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or  fired.  The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in  California over the past 10 years, including current employees,  focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for  not meeting sales quotas.  ""Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet  unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to  employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,""  the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los  Angeles County said.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as  2 million accounts in customers' names without their  authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles  prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo's reputation.

The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in  California over the past 10 years, including current employees,  focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for  not meeting sales quotas.  ""Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet  unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to  employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,""  the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los  Angeles County said.  Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as  2 million accounts in customers' names without their  authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles  prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells.  The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo's reputation.

Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests  and were counseled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit  said.  While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the  blame landed on thousands of $12-per-hour employees who tried to  meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to  do so, the lawsuit said.  Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without  engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages,  benefits and suffering anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment,  the lawsuit said.  Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened,  unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of  unethical business practices, the lawsuit said.

All three big American companies are constantly refreshing their lineups to cling to any advantages over the competition.That's big trouble for Toyota, which hasn't completely redesigned its Tundra pickup since 2007. It's received a slew of updates and a large refresh in 2014, but sales have always lagged behind the big three in Detroit. In a segment of six, the Tundra is the fifth-place finisher, besting only Nissan's Titan in sales.After a week with one, it's not hard to see why. It's well built and isn't as pricey as the American trucks, but we still wouldn't recommend one.As of last week, there have now been two Toyota Tundras of this generation that have reached one million miles on their original transmissions. That's a seriously impressive feat, a testament to the reputation Toyota trucks have long maintained for unbeatable reliability.Part of that comes from simplicity. For the buyers that bemoan Ford moving toward turbocharging, Ram putting in mild-hybrid systems and GMC offering tailgates that fold in a variety of ways, the Tundra's old-school style may be refreshing.It's got a 5.7-liter V-8 linked to a six-speed transmission, providing 381 horsepower. It's not the most powerful engine in its class, but it offers more than enough power to work in day-to-day life without taxing the motor. There's enough reserve power that it'd be fine loaded up with gear, people and a trailer.Plus — though Toyota still has a lot to learn from American trucks in other categories — the Japenese company has certainly matched the in-your-face, bombastic styling of the big three. The Tundra looks like a sledgehammer, with a broad and aggressive face and oversized details. Our $46,610 tester looked alright, but in TRD Pro guise the Tundra is a mean looking machine.It also came in about $17,000 cheaper than the last Ram we tested, though it was significantly lighter on feature content and lacked the Ram's crew cab, bed liner and integrated bed cargo system. Credit to Toyota, though, for including active safety features like forward collision warning in all Tundras.The downside of two current-generation Tundras having hit one million miles is that it draws attention to just how long the truck has been on sale. In a rapidly changing market, the Tundra feels ancient. It's by far the oldest vehicle in the segment. The infotainment system is far behind the competition; Ram offers a 12-inch portrait touch screen, but Toyota makes do with a screen that looks largely the same as it did in 2014. The interior materials are hard plastics that look cheap and it's behind on tech.Most notably, the newest crop of huge trucks offer 360-degree cameras and self-parking systems to help drivers manage the behemoths. The Tundra doesn't, a shame since it feels more unwieldy than other full-size trucks.It lumbers around without a sense of poise or refinement, making it hard to place the truck where you want it. It, of course, didn't help that the Tundra we tested was equipped with the longer bed option. Even still, the handling was poor.Power, as mentioned, was adequate. Unfortunately, the old-school way that the Tundra makes the power isn't particularly efficient. The Tundra with the 5.7-liter V-8 is rated for 17 miles per gallon on the highway, while a Ram 1500 with a 5.7-liter V-8 is good for 21 mpg on the highway. Add the eTorque mild hybrid option and that climbs to 22 mpg.And then it comes to luxury. Pickup truck buyers are increasingly opting for more expensive, more optioned trucks. The Tundra offers none of the refinement of the luxurious trims of the competition and the options list is significantly shorter.Of course, longtime truck buyers might not care about tech or luxury features. Complaining about those things may come off as missing the point. And to some extent, they're right. If the Tundra was more capable than its rivals, a lot could be forgiven.Unfortunately, it's not. The Tundra is not the most powerful, it doesn't tow the most and it doesn't have a higher payload capacity than its rivals. Rivals also offer more engine choices, more cab configurations and things like corner steps and in-bed locking storage that make work duties more manageable.The Tundra makes sense for some buyers. If your primary focus is on reliability, there's a solid argument to be made that this is the most dependable vehicle on sale. If you are fine with the options it offers, it can also undercut similarly equipped trucks from the Detroit brands.But you'll always be aware of the lower price. The Tundra feels substantially cheaper than rival trucks. It's not as comfortable, quiet or livable. It feels clumsy, unlike the pseudo-luxury experiences offered by top-trim rivals.It's also not the most capable or configurable truck. We can't argue that it's unbelievably reliable and extremely well built, but in a fiercely competitive segment that isn't enough to offset the Tundra's downsides.Exterior: 3.5Interior: 1.5Driving experience: 2Value: 2.5Overall: 2.4Price as tested: $46,610*Ratings out of 5",12:08.7

345,Health-care maze remains for undocumented immigrants,2014-11-25T19:08:51+0000,Dan Mangan,"President Obama's executive order preventing the deportation of  up to 5 million undocumented immigrants won't preclude all of  them from getting affordable health coverage. But it remains to  be seen just how many will be presented with that option.   Even if a good amount do get insurance, the health, social  and economic costs from having the remaining immigrants  effectively locked out of health coverage will remain a problem,  say advocates and analysts.  And some of those  costs—including visits to  emergency rooms that aren't paid by  insurance—could end up getting  passed along to the general public, they noted.  Undocumented immigrants, who currently comprise one in every six  people in the United States without health insurance, by 2017 are  projected to make up 1 in 4 such uninsured people, said Stephen  Zuckerman, co-director of the Health Policy Center at the Urban  Institute.  Zuckerman noted that it's not because there will be more  undocumented immigrants without insurance.

""This issue of health coverage has been separated from their  legal status and the ability to work,"" Zuckerman said. ""And  that's going to leave a large number of people without coverage,  and without the ability to get coverage either through Medicaid  or the subsidies in the marketplace.""  That decision to separate health coverage out of the equation  echoes a similar decision in 2013 by the Obama administration  when it deferred deportation for young undocumented immigrants  said they could not benefit from Obamacare subsidies, said  Shannon Erwin, state policy director at the Massachusetts  Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.  ""It was a political decision, and not really a health  policy-informed decision,"" said Erwin, pointing out that the  Obamacare exchanges were due to launch later that same  year.   ""I would hope there would be an an opportunity to re-open that  conversation,"" said Erwin, who noted that health coverage is ""a  top concern"" among immigrants.  But Derrick Morgan, vice president for economic freedom and  opportunity of the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that  while, ""I think the administration would like"" to expand  subsidies to those affected people, it shouldn't do so.  ""The president promised that illegal immigrants would not receive  funding for Obamacare,"" Morgan said. The Heritage Foundation, he  said, opposes having undocumented workers receive health coverage  from government-sponsored or government-subsidized programs.  ""They're here unlawfully, and the American taxpayer and the  American citizens are the ones paying for these benefits, and  these subsidies should not be going to those that are here  illegally,"" Morgan said. Read MoreObama's immigration plan risks  backlash   That said, the people covered by Obamas order will have several  avenues for health coverage as they become eligible for work  permits.   ""More people will have jobs,"" noted Claudia Calhoon, senior  health specialist with with the New York Immigration Coalition.  ""They will have more financial stability because they no longer  will be in the shadows.""  With some of those job, people will be offered employer-sponsored  insurance, Calhoon said. They will also have the option of buying  unsubsidized individual insurance outside the Obamacare  exchanges, at the least, although Calhoon noted such  ""off-exchange"" plans can be much more expensive than the ones  sold on the exchanges.  ""It will be very important to get the word out to people so they  understand what benefits are available to them,"" she said. ""Educating immigrant communities about what options do  exist, and safety services for people who are uninsured, will be  important.  But it's not clear how many of the immigrants subject to Obama's  order will be able to buy—and able to afford—health  coverage through their jobs or in the individual health plans,  said Samatha Artiga, director of the Disparities Policy Project  at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  ""We do know, historically, that immigrants have been more likely  to have low-wage job and be in industries that do not provide  health-care coverage to workers,"" said Artiga.  And even if they are offered coverage through their employer, ""In  many cases, that's unaffordable,"" she said.  Artiga said Obama's order could alleviate the fears of being  deported that have kept some of the affected undocumented  immigrants from enrolling their U.S.-born children in Medicaid  and CHIP health insurance programs that those kids are eligible  for due to their citizenship status.  ""From past research and experience, that has always been a big  barrier for enrolling children in those mixed-status families,""  she said.   ""But I think the broader issue is that individuals remain without  access to affordable health coverage options, so many of them may  remain uninsured.""  But that doesn't mean they will stay out of the hospital.  Uninsured undocumented immigrants, along with other uninsured  Americans who visit the emergency room and get other hospital  services despite being unable to pay for their care, in 2012  generated nearly $46 billion in uncompensated care costs at 4,999  U.S. hospitals in 2012, the last year data was available,  according to the American Hospital Association.  Those costs, equal to 6.1 percent of total hospital expenses, end  up being covered by a federally funded program, by extra charges  to those with insurance, or by the hospitals themselves.  While the AHA doesn't have data on how much of those costs are  due to undocumented immigrants, they can be considerable in  individual cases.  Dr. Julia Koehler, a pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, told CNBC about how an undocumented  Brazilian immigrant had previously sought her help after incurring  a back injury he suffered while trying to lift an older, heavier  stranger who had slipped and fallen on some ice on a sidewalk.For more than two weeks the immigrant, a father of three,  had avoided going to the doctor because he lacked insurance, said  Koehler, a Harvard Medical School assistant professor who volunteers at a clinic that serves immigrants.  ""He ended up with an emergent injury to his spinal cord, which  was a prolapse of the disc into the spinal canal,"" Koehler said.  When he was properly diagnosed by ""an excellent neurosurgeon,""  Koehler said, the man was told he had more than a 50 percent risk  of paralysis.  ""He was going to lose control of his feet, his bladder and his  bowel, and not be able to work anymore because he didn't have  health insurance,"" Koehler said. Read MoreTech world needs high-skilled  foreigners: CEO   Fortunately, the man's surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in  Boston was a success, and he made a full recovery, she said. But  the surgery itself cost ""tens of thousands of dollars,"" which he  was unable to pay, and which the hospital absorbed.  While the man's story has a happy ending, Koehler said in other  cases, breadwinner in immigrant families are hurt on the job or  get sick elsewhere, and then are left temporarily or permanently  unable to support their families, which can in turn lead to  health issues for them as well, and them becoming an economic  burden to hospitals and taxpayers.  Even an immigrant going without a flu shot because of lack of  insurance can lead to significant costs for others, she said.  ""If you don't have health insurance and you have low income, it  is very unlikely that you will come up with the money to buy a  flu shot,"" Koehler said. ""So the unimmunized person will then  possibly expose other vulnerable people, perhaps asthmatics,  young infants, older people.""  ""Health insurance should be available regardless of immigration  status, because, again, it goes beyond the health of the affected  individuals, and it goes to the health of the whole family and  the whole community,"" she said.",12:08.7

350,'Powerful and dangerous' Hurricane Ida is on the verge of landfall in Louisiana ,2021-08-29T10:32:53+0000,,"Hurricane Ida was on the verge of making landfall in the United States on Sunday as an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm that could plunge much of the Louisiana shoreline underwater as the state grapples with a Covid-19 surge already taxing hospitals.Ida gathered more strength overnight, faster than meteorologists had predicted only a day ago. It is the toughest test yet for the hundreds of miles of new levees built around New Orleans after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall 16 years ago to the day, inundating historically Black neighborhoods and killing more than 1,800 people.Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that the storm, due to make landfall by Sunday afternoon, could be the state's worst direct hit by a hurricane since the 1850s.The state is also dealing with the nation's third-highest rate of new COVID-19 infections, with about 3,400 new cases reported on Friday alone. Hospitals were treating some 2,450 COVID-19 patients, Edwards said, with those in many of the state's parishes already nearing capacity.By early Sunday, Ida was a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. At 11 a.m. CDT (1600 GMT) it was located about 60 miles (95 km) west-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and some 85 miles (135 km) south of New Orleans, carrying top sustained winds of 150 miles per hour (240 km per hour).Rain gusted through New Orleans on Sunday morning, where retired 68-year-old Robert Ruffin had evacuated with his family to a downtown hotel from their home in the city's east.""I thought it was safer,"" he said. ""It's double trouble this time because of COVID.""IDA's landfall was only a few hours away, according to the NHC, which warned of life-threatening storm surges, potentially catastrophic wind damage and flooding rainfall.""We're as prepared as we can be, but we're worried about those levees,"" said Kirk Lepine, president of Plaquemines Parish on the state's Gulf Coast.Plaquemines is one of the most vulnerable parishes, where 23,000 people live along the Mississippi delta stretching into the Gulf. Lepine feared levees along Highway 23 were not up to task.""Water could go over top,"" he said. ""That's our one road in and out.""Edwards told CNN on Sunday that he believed the state's levees would be able to withstand the storm surge, though he expressed some doubt about parishes, like Plaquemines, in the south.""Where we're less confident is further south where you have other protection systems that are not built to that same standard,"" he said. ""That's where we are most concerned about the impact of storm surge.""He said on Saturday there were no plans to evacuate patients from hospitals, and that state officials had been speaking with hospitals to ensure their generators were working and that they had more water on hand than normal.Officials ordered widespread evacuations of low-lying and coastal areas, jamming highways and leading some gasoline stations to run dry as residents and vacationers fled.""This is a powerful and dangerous storm.

Regional fuel prices rose in anticipation of production losses and on increased demand due to evacuations.Coastal and inland oil refineries also began to cut production due to the storm. Phillips 66 shut its Alliance plant on the coast in Belle Chasse, while Exxon Mobil cut production at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery on Saturday.Jean Paul Bourg, 39, was planning to ride out the storm in Morgan City, about 70 miles (112 km) west of New Orleans. His wife's brother was recently released from the hospital after contracting COVID-19 and secured a generator to ensure access to oxygen if needed.""You can't necessarily pile in with family members during Covid,"" Bourg said, after trimming trees and putting up plywood on his house.

But that was merely the midpoint of forecasts that ranged all the way from -10% to -4.2%. The difference gets even more pronounced in 2021, where the median is a 5% gain but the range goes from -1% — in essence, a continuation of the recession that started in February 2020 — to a 7% gain, which would be the fastest one-year growth rate since 1984.The outlook for unemployment and inflation all showed a substantial disparity of opinions.","cnbc, Articles, Federal Reserve Bank, Economic growth, Economic policy, COVID-19, Coronavirus, Economy, Markets, Jerome Powell, U.S. Markets, US: News, CNBC Data Visualizations, Business News, The Fed, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","The Federal Reserve's economic outlook isn't so much pessimistic as it is uncertain, with expectations running a wide gamut from a plodding recovery to a sharp rebound.If that sounds a lot like the market lately, it's probably not a coincidence.Following its two-day meeting earlier this week, the Fed released its Summary of Economic Projections for GDP, unemployment, inflation and interest rates.

The surge came against a bevy of jaw-dropping economic numbers that showed how much damage the pandemic has caused.""They've been pretty honest and straightforward about the high level of uncertainty that they see around how the economy's progressing, which is nice,"" Kathy Jones, head of fixed income for Charles Schwab, said of the Fed policymakers.""We all know the second quarter is the trough and things will get better and the market is trying to discount that,"" she added. ""But I think the markets got pretty carried away.""Indeed, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been emphasizing that even with all of the rescue funding that the central bank and Congress have been providing, the strength of the recovery is largely dependent on the path of the coronavirus. Powell even noted at the end of this week's meeting that the SEP readings should be viewed cautiously. Because so much was unknown, the Fed declined to provide the quarterly summary at its main March policy meeting but elected to do so this week even with abundant questions about the future.""Given the unusually high level of uncertainty about the outlook, many participants noted that they see a number of reasonably likely paths for the economy and that's not possible to identify with confidence a single path as the most likely one,"" Powell said Wednesday, noting that the SEP was ""a full range of plausible outcomes and not one particular forecast.""At a time when fears of a second round of Covid-19 infections are heightened, the Fed's sketchy outlook helped precipitate a wicked Thursday market slide that was only partially offset by a Friday rally that continued to weaken as the day progressed. President Donald Trump weighed in Thursday, saying the Fed is ""wrong so often"" even though its 2021 forecast is for the fastest pace of growth since Ronald Reagan was president.The Fed offered no additional policy tools to help guide the economy through what promises to be a murky road ahead, only assurances that short-term benchmark interest rates would remain anchored near zero through at least 2022.The SEP ""showed a remarkably wide range of potential outcomes for the American economy over the next 2 years,"" wrote Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. ""Despite that, the Fed did not announce anything new [Wednesday] aside from some assurance that it will not employ negative interest rates.""Markets for the moment are no longer pricing in a chance that the Fed in fact would go to negative rates anytime soon, despite persistent speculation that it might follow the example of Europe and Japan if things continued to deteriorate.But the chasm of economic expectations between officials serves as a reminder of how in flux the future can be, even as investors continue to price in a best-case scenario.""In the end, equity markets have made their bullish bet about future corporate profits specifically and the state of the US economy more generally,"" Colas said. ""Even a Federal Reserve with an unabashedly uncertain outlook will not change that much.""",12:09.7

That is, the massive run-up in values could suddenly result in investors having more exposure toward bitcoin — and its risks — than they'd like.Similarly, while cashing out of your holdings might seem attractive, it could come with a hefty capital gains tax bill on the appreciation.More from Advisor Insight:How financial advisors say to use your $600 stimulus checkHere's who's likely eligible for a second stimulus checkCovid relief bill adds PPP tax breaks the Treasury opposedThat's where charitable giving comes into play.""We believe in asset diversification, and because the price of bitcoin rose significantly, investors could be overallocated based on their targets for their portfolio,"" said Stefan Podvojsky, senior vice president of Fidelity Charitable.""A donor advised fund provides a great outlet to remove that overweight and support the philanthropy that is important to the donor,"" he said.Indeed, investors in bitcoin have been able to donate their holdings to donor-advised funds via Fidelity Charitable since 2015.Benefactors have given close to $26 million in bitcoin to Fidelity Charitable's donor-advised funds year to date as of Dec. 29.Donor-advised funds are accounts generous investors can fund with a variety of assets and use for making grants to their favorite charitable causes.Nevertheless, giving away bitcoin and other crypto assets can come with a unique set of hurdles, including price volatility and additional tax reporting on the part of the investor.Though you can convert cryptocurrency into dollars, the IRS regards it as property for income tax purposes.This means you're subject to capital gains taxes if you decide to sell or exchange your virtual currency holdings.The magnitude of the tax hit will depend on how long you've held your bitcoin — if it's at least a year, you may qualify for the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15% or 20% — and your cost basis in the asset.Investors who snapped up bitcoin when it was especially cheap — consider that one bitcoin was worth $7,220 Dec. 30, 2019 — may face the harshest tax consequences when they sell or exchange it.That's because the tax would be based on the difference between their cost basis and today's market price.Meanwhile, donating an asset you've held for at least a year will allow you to claim a tax deduction based on its fair market value.""Donating it could be incredibly tax-conducive,"" said Bryan Clontz, founder and president of Charitable Solutions, a firm that specializes in receiving and liquidating noncash assets for charities.""It's the holy grail of charitable planning: a low basis, highly appreciated asset,"" he said.Another reason why donating crypto via a donor-advised fund might make sense: Your favorite charity may be skittish about accepting direct contributions of virtual currency due to data security issues.""The big issue for charities is the volatility and the risk that if you set up your own wallet, wallets can be hacked,"" said Greg Sharkey, senior philanthropy advisor at The Nature Conservancy, a charity in Arlington, Virginia.The organization teamed up with BitPay, a bitcoin payment service provider, to accept donations and convert them to cash.""If the donor calls this morning and wants to make gifts and does it through BitPay, the money would be at the charity's account tomorrow,"" said Sharkey.What makes cryptocurrency so complex is the fact that not only are these assets subject to price volatility, but they also trade constantly.Generally, the deduction a donor can claim is based on the price of the asset on the date they relinquish control to the donor-advised fund.Fidelity Charitable only trades bitcoin during New York Stock Exchange market hours, or 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern, on weekdays, said Podvojsky. ""Depending on when during the day you might transfer the bitcoin to us, you would be subject to the price in the market and the liquidity we would be able to obtain at that point in time,"" he said.Investors hoping to claim a tax deduction for their donation have extra legwork.Because they're giving away a special asset, they must obtain a qualified appraisal from a third party and file Form 8283 with the IRS.""Roughly $500 to $600 per appraisal would be the market for this space, and you'd have to have a larger donation to make it worth it,"" said Clontz. ""There's a cost to the donor, and it's not just five minutes of work.""Giving away those appreciated bitcoin holdings and collecting a tax write-off isn't just a one-person effort. Here are a few considerations:Gather your experts: Financial advisors have a bird's eye view of a client's holdings, but they'll likely need to link up with the client's accountant and a qualified appraiser to ensure the investor maximizes his tax deduction for the donation.Consider taking the donor-advised fund route: Volatility and data security are chief concerns for charities, and not all of them are equipped to take direct donations of crypto assets. A donor-advised fund can receive the gift, convert it and allow you to make grants to your favorite charities.Maintain solid records. The IRS has made no secret of its interest in crypto assets. The front page of the 2020 income tax return asks whether you've transacted in virtual currency over the year. Be sure to hold on to any acknowledgement letters you receive from charities, as well as your appraisal documents.Correction: New York Stock Exchange market hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern on weekdays.

These manuals, branded Techbooks, come with all the Internet frills: video, virtual labs, downloadable content.But the Techbook may be most notable for what it does not have — backing from a traditional educational publisher. Instead it has the support of Discovery, the cable TV company. Discovery, which also sells an educational video service to school districts, is entering the digital textbook market largely because it sees a growth opportunity too good to pass up. Conventional textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade are a $3 billion business in the United States, according to the Association of American Publishers, with an additional $4 billion spent on teacher guides, testing resources and reference materials. And almost all that printed material, educators say, will eventually be replaced by digital versions. “It’s kind of perfect for us,” said David M. Zaslav, chief executive of Discovery Communications, which owns networks like Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and TLC. “Educational content is core to our DNA, and we’re unencumbered — unlike traditional textbook publishers, we’re not defending a dying business.” Mr. Zaslav is not the only media executive talking grandly about education these days. Movies, television, newspapers and magazines are in decline or facing headwinds, putting pressure on media companies to find new areas of expansion. Education is emerging as an answer, largely because executives see a way to capitalize on the changes that technology is bringing to classrooms — turnabout as fair play, given the way that the Web has upended major media’s own business models. “We think the opportunity continues to be to use digital technologies to be disruptive to an enormous business stuck decades in the past,” Chase Carey, News Corporation’s chief operating officer, told analysts this year. News Corporation is betting on just that. This month, the company said it would infuse its fledgling education division, Amplify, with $100 million. Amplify, focused on digital teaching and assessment tools, is run by Joel I. Klein, the former New York City schools chancellor. Rupert Murdoch, the chief executive of News Corporation, has said he would be “thrilled” if education were to account for 10 percent of its revenue five years from now. Old-line education companies, however, may be more difficult prey than Mr. Zaslav and Mr. Murdoch think. Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are introducing digital educational products of their own, and these stalwarts have a technology giant on their side: Apple , seeking to bolster iPad sales, recently started selling digital high school textbooks through its iBooks store, with those three publishers as partners. “Over the last 10 years alone, we’ve invested $9.3 billion in digital innovations that are transforming education,” said Will Ethridge, chief executive of Pearson North America, part of Pearson P.L.C., the world’s largest education and learning company. “One way to describe it would be an act of ‘creative destruction.’ By this I mean we’re intentionally tearing down an outdated, industrial model of learning and replacing it with more personalized and connected experiences for each student.” On a smaller scale, NBCUniversal has been building a service called NBC Learn, which digitizes and archives articles from NBC News to sell as a database and digital blackboard learning system; NBC Learn now operates in 5,000 schools in 43 states. The Financial Times, owned by Pearson, is pushing MBA Newslines, a subscriber-only feature on its Web site that lets business students and professors create and share annotations on articles, allowing case studies to be built around real-time news events. And then there is the Walt Disney Company . It is building a chain of language schools in China big enough to enroll more than 150,000 children annually. The schools, which weave Disney characters into the curriculum, are not going to move the profit needle at a company with $41 billion in annual revenue. But they could play a vital role in creating a consumer base as Disney builds a $4.4 billion theme park and resort in Shanghai. Media companies have dipped their toes into education before, of course, only to find chilly waters. Discovery in 2006 promoted Cosmeo, an Internet-based service that offered children videos and other tools to help them with their homework; a year later, Discovery decided to stop marketing the product, which cost $99 a year, and laid off much of its staff. (Why pay for help when you can search Google at no cost?) In 2007, Disney introduced a new position — senior vice president for learning — with the goal of moving into the North American education businesses. None of the company’s major efforts got off the ground, and Disney eventually pulled the plug, in part because it decided technology was changing the sector too rapidly. News Corporation faces perception hurdles as it moves deeper into education — namely what some rivals refer to as the “Foxification” of schools, a pointed reference to Fox News Channel and its stable of conservative pundits. The company has said it has zero interest in inserting politics into schools, and notes that other assets, including the National Geographic Channel, which, like Discovery’s flagship channel, largely focuses on documentaries and educational programming, could play to the company’s advantage. Last year, the New York State comptroller, citing News Corporation’s phone-hacking scandal in Britain, rejected a $27 million contract with its education division. The decision underscored one of the biggest hurdles faced by companies entering the education market: new products must typically gain state approval before schools even have the chance to decide to buy them. Wall Street is skeptical that education holds as much promise as some media companies think. “When big conglomerates feel their core businesses have started to mature, they look for related synergistic businesses,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “You have to ask yourself, are those education businesses really related and synergistic in core?” Bill Goodwyn, chief executive of Discovery’s education unit, says in his company’s case, the answer is an emphatic yes. He conceded that Cosmeo “lost a lot of money,” but said that Discovery’s business had centered on education since its earliest days. Discovery Channel’s original name was Cable Education Network, for instance, and the company used to make money by shipping VHS cassettes of documentaries to schools. Discovery currently sells a popular subscription streaming service to schools, which comes with 50,500 video segments and 6,200 full-length videos on topics like math, social studies and language arts. The service costs $1,570 a year for a school that serves kindergarten through eighth grade; high schools pay $2,095. Still, Discovery’s previous efforts pale in scope to its Techbook initiative. Mr. Goodwyn’s 200-employee division introduced the line of digital textbooks last year. Their cloud-based technology works with whatever hardware a district has — iPads, laptops, desktops. Discovery tailors them to the particular curriculum needs of various states (or districts within states). “As a 30-year veteran, it was not always easy giving up some of the more traditional ways of teaching,” said Roseann Burklow, a seventh-grade science teacher in Mooresville, N.C. “But I love the Techbook. Students are engaged and can work independently or collaboratively.” (She did suggest one improvement: more games to help students review material for tests.) Traditional textbooks cost about $70 a student; Discovery’s Techbooks start at $38 a student for a six-year subscription and go up to $55, depending on the subject and grade level. Discovery knows education will never pay its bills. Last year, the company’s learning products, for instance, generated adjusted operating income of $23 million, a 53 percent increase over a year earlier. In comparison, its United States cable networks delivered operating income of $1.5 billion, a 10 percent increase from a year earlier. Still, Mr. Zaslav said the education unit’s small size did not dim his enthusiasm. “Television is always going to be our primary focus, but we’re incredibly excited about the business potential of the Techbook,” he said. “Education is an area of solid, sustainable growth.”",12:10.9

And indeed, his company evolved from a one-man business selling merchandise from liquidators at the age of 12, to a full-fledged business with 120 employees.Phillips talks about how Evo got its start,why it has thrived, and where he plans on taking the company from here. Where did you get the idea for your business?I originally started buying and selling gear to pay for my skiing. When I was in junior high and high school, I was selling equipment just to finance ski trips and equipment. In college I would go to places that were going out of business and I would buy a bunch of boots and resell them. I made a good margin and it allowed me to reinvest and put money into skiing, I wasn’t really building a brand or company, or anything beyond what I was selling to pay for the sport. Where did the funding first come from?[When I decided to turn the sideline into a full-time business], it was all credit cards and loans from family. I used school loans to help buy a house, then re-mortgaged my house. I was finding cash wherever I could; you know, the typical founder stuff. It took quite a while. I was fixing up and selling houses, then brought on individual investors. Our first round was in 2008 when I was introduced to people in Seattle who were in the business. At that time, I got a little more than $1 million; and two years ago it was a bigger round, around $9 million through word of mouth.Who was your first customer?I was selling to kids I went to school with in Roseburg, Ore. I bought a bunch of ski boots from a retailer going out of business and sold 10 pairs of boots. I hung flyers around town, but most of it was word of mouth: People knew I had gear and was selling it at a good price.When did you know the company would be a success?I’ve always had the confidence it would be. It was naive, for sure, but I guess I always had an understanding what did exist and didn’t exist in the market. And then, tying it into all the elements that surrounded it into the culture. One thing led to another. I sold skis out of my dorm room, and it just grew and grew and grew. Later on in life, you realize there are big challenges and you’re not sure for a moment, but you get through those. What’s next?We have a huge opportunity to open stores nationwide. We have an opportunity to grow Evo-branded product. Right now we do small bits of Evo-branded products, such as clothing and accessories. We want to make that a bigger category for our business, with outwear and street wear.Follow Jessica Naziri on Twitter @jessicanaziri",12:11.0

Just 9 percent said they saw the economic outlook as ""positive,""  while 34 percent said it was satisfactory.Almost a third believed Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP),  the widest measure of economic growth, would expand by between  1-1.9 percent next year; this was a 7 percent decline in the  number that expected similarly positive growth in the CPA's 2014  poll.

According to the new poll, 25 percent said GDP growth would  decline in 2016, a 13 percent rise in the number of pessimistic  votes on the year preceding.   ""There is no doubt that the survey results show that economic  sentiment for 2016 has turned negative and many respondents  believe our competitiveness is declining,"" Kenneth Chen,  divisional president of greater China at CPA Australia, said in a  press release.   The main threats to Hong Kong's competitiveness were seen as  coming from mainland China, despite the volatility that affected  Chinese markets in the third quarter, and from Singapore, the CPA  Australia study found. About 67 percent of the respondents  thought Hong Kong's competitiveness will decline in  2016.   Last month, the World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked Hong Kong  seventh in its Global Competitiveness Index, while Singapore  ranked second and China was 28th. Hong Kong has been ranked in  the same place for three straight years, with the latest report  noting ""the challenge for Hong Kong is to evolve from one of the  world's foremost financial hubs to an innovative powerhouse.""  Hong Kong scored low marks for innovation.   The downbeat view of Hong Kong's outlook is echoed by some  analysts and economists.  Rajiv Biswas, chief economist for Asia Pacific at IHS Global  Insight, told CNBC by email: ""Hong Kong is particularly  vulnerable to an economic slowdown in China, due to the  increasingly close economic ties with the mainland."" He added  that the impact of China's growth slowdown was already visible in  Hong Kong's economic data.   Hong Kong's total merchandise exports fell by 1 percent on-year  in the first eight months of  2015; exports to China were  down by 2.2 percent. And slow growth in tourism from the mainland  hit Hong Kong's retail sales, which clocked a 5.4 percent  year-on-year decline in August.   Read MoreHas Hong Kong lost its  center of vice?  ""In recent months, mainland tourism visits to Hong Kong have  shown a dramatic slump, with total mainland Chinese tourist  arrivals in August down [by] 7.1 [percent] compared to a year  ago,"" said Biswas.  An economic slowdown, along with crackdown on corruption on the  mainland, also affected sales of luxury brands in Hong  Kong.   ""Sales of [luxury] watches and jewelry in Hong Kong [was] down  8.8 [percent] year-on-year in August 2015,"" Biswas noted.  But some believe that for an advanced economy, the projected GDP  figures are acceptable.    In a July report on Hong Kong's outlook, Moody's Analytics said  that though the region's growth was expected to come in between 1  and 3 percent for the coming two years, the projected figure was  ""still robust for an advanced, high income economy.""   ""Hong Kong has significant buffers to guard against financial and  economic shocks,"" the report noted, citing the region's strong  fiscal reserves and international investment position.  In a September report, Moody's issued a revised forecast for Hong  Kong's growth outlook to 2.2 percent for 2016.   Even sometimes tense political relations with Beijing were  ""unlikely to affect economic policies or result in political  protests of a scale that could hinder growth or dent Hong Kong's  status as an international financial center,"" Moody's July report  noted. Read MoreHong Kong's cultural hotspots you may not know about  In June Hong Kong's legislature rejected a Beijing-supported  electoral bill that proposed Hong Kong residents should vote for  their next leader from a list of candidates approved by the  Chinese government.  The CPA Australia study said that closer economic collaboration  with China would help Hong Kong's economy overcome the negative  outlook currently prevalent, especially in sectors such as  e-commerce, healthcare, banking and finance.   ""China has introduced a number of policies and initiatives that  will undoubtedly help drive economic growth in Hong Kong,' noted  Chen.   Beijing has used a number of fiscal and monetary policies to  stabilize its stock markets and keep growth on track, as well as  launching initiatives to establish closer business and trade ties  with countries in the region.    These initiatives include the new Asian Infrastructure Investment  Bank (AIIB), the Belt and Road initiative, which aims to be one  of the largest trade and infrastructure networks connecting the  Asia Pacific and Europe, and free trade zones.",12:11.0

Tsarnaev is suspected of setting off two bombs at the Boston  Marathon with his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, on April 15.  At his first public appearance since his arrest, Tsarnaev pleaded  not guilty to 30 charges brought against him by federal  prosecutors in the U.S. District Court.  Fernandez-O'Brien echoed other online critics, voicing concern  over whether the magazine is glorifying Tsarnaev and his actions  by giving him so much attention.""Obviously it's what people want to see,"" he said. ""Definitely.

Others, including journalism professor at Northeastern University and  frequent media commentator Dan Kennedy, argue that the cover  choice is not only not controversial, but a smart editorial  decision on behalf of Rolling Stone.  ""I think it's important to be responsible,"" he said. ""It's nice to say that  we should keep our focus on the victims of this awful crime and  not glamorize someone like Tsarnaev, and I agree with that, but  at the same time I think that we all want to know what drove him  to commit this terrible crime, and he's interesting, and that's  the definition of news.""   Kennedy did agree that Tsarnaev looks glamorous on the over, but  that every picture he has seen of the alleged bomber from the  Boston Globe to The New York Times shows Tsarnaev in the same  way.  He also noted the magazine's history of featuring high-profile  news as feature and cover stories, such as its 1970 cover of  Charles Manson.""I suppose you could say this one was glammed up to an  unusual degree, but I thought it really worked very well because  it was an exercise in cognitive dissonance,"" he said.

Nonetheless, she is viewed as a strong and stable leader in Europe despite growing political turbulence in Germany and is something of a figurehead for the European Union (EU).Other European officials are keen to encourage Merkel to consider the Commission presidency role, praising her as a unifying figure in the bloc and a steady force that region needs when its political environment looks polarized and fractured.The next president of the Commission has to be approved by a majority of the 28 member states, but also by a majority of lawmakers at the European Parliament, the EU's legislative arm.There will also be a vote to replace the current President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, when his term also ends in November, as well as new leaders of the EU Parliament, the EU's foreign policy chief and the next president of the European Central Bank.Battle lines are already drawn between member states over the top jobs up for grabs. Donald Tusk has been consulting member states and the European Parliament about the positions. He has also said the EU should aim to have ""at least two women"" in the senior posts.Tweet:Tusk has said that he hoped the appointments would be agreed at an EU summit on June 20-21 when the bloc's 28 leaders next meet.- CNBC's Silvia Amaro contributed reporting to this story.",12:11.8

The tariffs will go into effect later this month.The end goal in Trump's eyes is for these countries to lower the tariffs they have on American goods, thus improving the market for the U.S. Some say his plan could work as the U.S. is negotiating from a position of strength -- a strong economy and low unemployment rates.But as the fight continues, some companies are having to absorb the blow.

The Poplar Bluff company said it raised prices but customers defected. The company said it worries more layoffs will occur and that by Labor Day the entire 500-member workforce would be terminated.SEMO Box, a packaging company in Cape Girardeau, said it has felt a ripple effect from Mid-Continent's slowing business. The company said it would be laying off four temporary workers because of the slowdown, according to the Associated Press and Mid-Continent.Harley-Davidson plans to shift a portion of its U.S. motorcycle manufacturing outside the U.S. in response to the trade fight. The Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer said Monday in a public filing that the move is necessary to preserve its second-biggest sales market after new tariffs were imposed by the European Union.The company did not specify whether it would close any U.S. plants or lay off any workers. But Harley recently mapped out plans to shift some production to a new factory in Thailand and said it would close its plant in Kansas City, Missouri, and add some jobs at a facility in York, Pennsylvania.About 100 employees were laid off from REC Silicon, which supplies silicon materials for solar panels, in the company's Moses Lake plant. The plant also cut production by 25 percent, according to Reuters.The layoffs were a ""direct result of the ongoing solar trade dispute between China and the United States,"" the company told Fortune. China has imposed tariffs on polysilicon, which the company relies on.Trans-Matic, of Holland, Michigan, shapes metal, mostly into auto parts, as well as components for door locks. The company has been forced to pay higher steel prices over the last few months due to the trade negotiations. Those higher costs have been passed down to its auto-supplier customers, some of which have scaled back their business.Company Chief Financial Officer Steve Patterson said his employees are getting slightly fewer hours and have seen a slight decline in profits.Tariffs could cost up to 4,000 new jobs at a new Volvo plant that opened in South Carolina. Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters that the ""trade barriers and restrictions"" would prevent them from creating ""as many jobs as we are planning.""Element Electronics, a television-making company, said it might be forced to shut down its plant in Winnsboro unless certain items are removed from the tariff list that the company needs for production. The plant is one of the biggest job suppliers in Fairfield County and the company said it could be forced to lay off 126 people.Prices have increased at Vintage Industrial, a steel furniture company in Phoenix, because of the tariffs. Greg Hankerson, co-owner of the company, said the 25-percent tariff on imported steel has boosted raw-material costs, which forced him to raise prices 5 to 10 percent earlier this year for various items, with more price hikes possible.Many companies are holding out hope that the trade negotiations end quickly but have warned that job cuts and price increases could be imminent. BMW and General Motors sent their warnings in writing to the Department of Commerce.""This is hurting the economy but so far it's manageable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ""If the war continues to escalate, it will do more damage and at some point it will undercut the good economy"" and trigger significant job losses and likely a recession.Despite fears that the trade dispute could spiral out of control, which would slow global growth and dampen investor and business confidence, Wall Street pros still believe the president's use of tariffs as a negotiating tool will likely be a winner.""Right or wrong, many investors still feel the U.S. has the upper hand in this battle and will win in the end,"" says Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.That's because China has more to lose. The country's exports to the U.S., measured in dollars, outnumber American exports to China 3 to 1. That buying power is tough to replace.And although tariffs could cause prices for consumer products ranging from cars to washing machines to rise, ""the U.S. does not need China as much as China needs the U.S.,"" says Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel.",12:12.4

She is also a huge music festival fan having attended more than  30 since her first one at the age of 16.   Her idea is Comp-A-Tent, a fully compostable tent. Its primary  use is for festivals, in order to counter the environmental  impact of leaving tents behind once the party is over. Simply,  you buy the tent with your festival ticket, pitch it, enjoy the  festival, then when it's time to leave, you hand it into the  recycling bin area and it then decomposes at the same rate as  bread.   Her reasons for developing the tent came from personal  frustration from being at festivals and witnessing the number of  tents dumped, abandoned and otherwise left behind. She learned  that, on average, one in five tents are left behind at European  festivals, contributing over 750,000 tents every year to landfill  or incineration. These tents aren't feasibly recycled, never  break down and leach hazardous toxins. It is a problem that  plagues festivals. At Glastonbury this year, the clear up  cost for organisers was £780,000 ($990,000).   From China, Amanda would like to source materials and  manufacturing for her pilot launch. Currently Amanda has been  making prototypes with a hand iron and it takes over one day per  tent.

But this isn't quite right—and hasn't been  right since the financial crisis struck, as a new note from the  New York Fed shows.  Prior to the crisis, the lenders in the fed funds market  resembled the textbook narrative. That is, they were a somewhat  diverse group of financial institutions. Domestic bank  holding companies lent out 25 percent of the $221.7 billion of  fed funds traded in the second quarter of 2007, according to data assembled by the New York Fed. Foreign entities  accounted for 21.2 percent of fed funds lending. Stand-alone  commercial banks were 8.2 percent of the market. The regional  Federal Home Loan Banks collectively accounted for 45.3 percent  of the market.   In the last quarter of 2012, things were very different.The  market for fed funds had shrunk down to $60.28 billion and  lending was overwhelmingly dominated by the Federal Home Loan  Banks, which accounted for 73 percent of the fed funds lent. Bank  holding companies had shrunk to 13.6 percent, foreign entities to  just 5.8 percent, and stand-alone banks to 6.4 percent.  In other words, the fed funds market is nothing like the textbook  model of a variety of banks with different reserve positions  making deals with each other to reach a market equilibrium. It's  mostly banks borrowing fed funds from the Federal Home Loan  Banks.   To put it differently, the primary tool of monetary  policy—the FOMC target rate—now is mostly used to  influence overnight fed funds lending by Federal Home Loan  Banks.  Why the transformation?    The New York Fed offers a couple of explanations. First and  foremost, the Fed now pays interest on excess reserves. This  means that banks won't lend reserves if the rate in the fed funds  market is less that what they can earn by holding on to their  reserves in accounts at the Fed. The Federal Home Loan Banks,  however, are government-sponsored entities that aren't allowed to  earn interest on excess reserves. So they'll lend out reserves  even at very low rates.  In addition, quantitative easing has greatly increased the  amount of reserves in the system, which means that banks are less  likely to find that they have too few reserves to meet the  regulatory requirements.  (Read more: Is the Fed really driving up stock prices?)  There is something strikingly odd about this arrangement. Our  central bank is now setting monetary policy by targeting an  interest rate charged by the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that were  established by Congress and are regulated by the Federal Housing  Finance Authority.      Sophisticated observers of the banking system have long pointed  out that banks do not ""lend out"" reserves. Rather  they make loans first and, if they are short required reserves,  find the reserves afterward on the fed funds market. We now need  to modify this with the observation that, by and large, banks  acquire the reserves not from some diverse ""fed funds market"" but  from the Federal Home Loan Banks.   (Read more: The irrelevance of bank reserves.)  No one, as far as I can tell, has really done much thinking about  what it means to have a fed funds market so dominated by  government-sponsored enterprises.  —By CNBC's John Carney.

In March, Lloyd along with her teammates Hope Solo, Alex Morgan,  Becky Sauerbrunn and Rapinoe, filed a complaint against the U.S.  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging that members of  the women's national team are paid significantly less than their  male counterparts.  ""Things are going well with that,"" said Lloyd. ""It's my  duty and our team's duty to continue this fight. I want to  leave the game better off than when I came on,"" she added.  Lloyd said they've received overwhelming support and  the real test will come when their collective bargaining deal is  up at the end of the year.  The 2015 FIFA World Cup winner also reflected on her former  teammate and best friend, Solo. The goalie received  a six-month suspension from the U.S. Women's National Team, coming  after the defeat by Sweden, where Solo called their team ""a  bunch of cowards."" Lloyd says she saddened by what happened, and she hopes it's not the end of Solo's career.  ""I think Hope is a very competitive person,"" she said. ""I  think her comments were not a jab at every player on Sweden. I think it was about their style of play. It was the  icing on the cake and the last string,"" she added.  ""At the end of the day, there isn't a whole lot that any of us  can do. This was  a decision U.S. soccer made, and  we'll have to see what happens.""  Lloyd also reflected on her role as co-captain of the U.S. Women's  National team and her leadership style.   Lloyd took the co-captain reins in January from superstar Abby Wambach, who retired. ""I think everyone is a   leader in different ways. She [Wambach]  was  very vocal, I'm more of a leader by example,"" said Lloyd.   Wambach, the highest-all-time goal scorer for the U.S. national  team, recently revealed in her own memoir, ""Forward,"" her struggles  with drugs and alcohol. ""I didn't know it was that bad,"" said  Lloyd. ""I know she's a fighter and will overcome this,"" she  added. ""She's a legend.""   So, what's next for the soccer phenom? ""Honestly, I'm not sure  what the next few years will bring me,"" said Lloyd.  But you  can count on soccer being involved. Lloyd said she wants to continue helping younger players develop  through her sports camps and helping teach ""mental  toughness.""

BUFFETT: IT IS NOT 20 TIMES EBITA THOUGH ANDREW. I AM NOT  SURE WHAT FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE BUT ALL DEALS SEEM  EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT THIS ONE WE ARE CERTAINLY PAYING A VERY GOOD  PRICE FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY RUN BY A PERSON THAN AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT HE  DOES.  SORKIN: HE'S MADE A NUMBER OF DEALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF  YEARS ABOUT 8 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK  AT THIS COMPANY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DO YOU IMAGINE  USING A LOT OF BERKSHIRE CASH TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO  USE IT AS A ROLL UP VEHICLE IF YOU WILL? BUFFETT: WELL ITS ALWAYS ACQUIRED COMPANIES I DON'T KNOW  HOW MANY ACQUISITIONS THEY MADE OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS A LOT.   BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO AEROSPACE IN  THE WAY OF PARTS AND THEY'VE GONE AFTER ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER  OVER THE YEARS.  IN FACT THEY'VE MADE A COUPLE SMALL DEALS I  BELIEVE IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER AND I THINK THEY'VE GOT MAYBE  ONE PENDING OR SO.  NOW THEY MAKE A GOOD BIT OF MONEY SO  THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO DO THE ACQUISITIONS OR MANY OF THE  ACQUISITIONS INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS BUT IF THEY NEED ANY  MONEY FROM BERKSHIRE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL.  QUICKLY: WARREN THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL IS THIS THE MOST  EXPENSIVE DEAL EVER?  HOW DOES IT MATCH UP TO BURLINGTON  NORTHERN? BUFFETT: WELL THE MOST DEALS ARE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK  OUT.  YOU MENTIONED DEXTER SHOE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IN  TERMS OF PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLES GOING IN THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE  AT THE TOP NOW WHEN WE BOUGHT BURLINGTON THAT WAS A HIGH PE BUT  IT WAS OFF A VERY DEPRESSED FIGURE BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THAT IN THE  FALL OF 2009 WHEN EARNINGS WERE AT A TROUGH.  AND PRECISIONS  EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN OFF MODERATELY BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE OIL AND GAS FIELD WHERE THEY DO SOME BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN  AEROSPACE SO BUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE FOR US. SULLIVAN: YOU READ MY MIND ON OIL AND GAS HOW MUCH OF THIS  IF AT ALL IS A BET THAT THE U.S. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAY BE  BOTTOMING OUT AT LEAST FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE? BUFFETT: WELL WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A 100  YEARS SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT OIL AND GAS  DOES IN THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF US BUYING IT.  IF SOMEONE  TOLD ME FOR SURE THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE  DULDRUMS WE'LL SAY FOR 3 YEARS I STILL WOULD HAVE MADE THE  DEAL.  THAT'S NOT A PREDICTION I AM JUST SAYING IT IS NOT  IMPORTANT TO US HOW LONG THE OIL AND GAS SLUMP LASTS WHEN YOU GET  A CHANCE TO BUY A WONDERFUL COMPANY YOU KNOW THERE IS USUALLY  SOME REASON WHY YOU ARE GETTING THAT CHANCE AND PERHAPS THE SLUMP  IN OIL AND GAS HELPS US IN THIS CASE.  BUT THERE WILL BE  SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SLUMP IN AEROSPACE AND THAT WILL BE MUCH  MORE SEVERE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE  DECADES BOTH OIL AND GAS AND AEROSPACE WILL BE GOOD BUSINESS AND  THESE FELLOWS ARE THEIR KEY PARTICULARLY IN THE AEROSPACE  BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM THEY'RE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS  THE MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE  DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF VERY  KEY PARTS THAT GO INTO ALL KINDS OF AIRCRAFTS.  SORKIN: WARREN SPEAK TO THE DEFENSIVE MODE THAT YOU OFTEN  TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR COMPANY IN TERMS OF  ITS MARKETSHARE AND ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IF NOT GROW THAT  MARKETSHARE BUFFETT:  WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT  HAVE PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT THAT IS A SMALL PART OF IT.   THEY DO HAVE MARVELOUS PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT WHAT YOU REALLY  NEED IS BRAIN POWER AND YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AT THE TOP YOU NEED  SOMEBODY WITH A TOTAL PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS AND I'VE MET MARK  FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME HE'S BEEN IN THE AIR AND HE'S IN  THE AIR ALMOST A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR THIS FELLOW LOVES THIS  BUSINESS LIKE I LOVE BERKSHIRE AND HE'S A LOT BETTER AT IT THAN I  AM AT BERKSHIRE. YOU CAN'T FIND PEOPLE LIKE THIS.  YOU  CERTAINLY CAN'T HIRE THEM.  THE ONE THING I GUARANTEE MARK  IS THAT HE'S RUNNING THE COMPANY.  PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE VERY  VERY RARE.  YOU CAN SEE IT IN WHAT HE HAS BUILT AND YOU CAN  SEE IT IN THE PASSION HE'S GOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING NOW.   HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BUSINESS IN THE  AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINES.  HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF  GETTING HIS COST TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.  HE JUST HAS A  PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS. QUICK:  WARREN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE  CASH THAT YOU ARE USING FOR THIS?  I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP  ABOUT 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH ON HAND.  ARE YOU STILL IN  THE MARKET FOR OTHER POTENTIAL DEALS? OR DOES THIS TAKE YOU OUT  OF THE MARKET FOR AWHILE? BUFFETT: THIS TAKES US OUT OF THE MARKET FOR AN ELEPHANT  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY BE BUYING A FEW SMALL THINGS IN THE NEXT 6  MONTHS.  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A COUPLE BUT IN TERMS OF  A DEAL OF SIMILAR SIZE IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES US OUT.  WHAT WE  WILL PROBABLY DO ON THIS ONE WE WILL PROBABLY BORROW ABOUT 10  BILLION AND USE ABOUT 23 BILLION OF OUR OWN CASH ON THAT  ORDER.  WE'LL BE LEFT WITH OVER 40 BILLION PROBABLY IN CASH  WHEN WE GET ALL THROUGH.  BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF CASH  AT ALL TIMES SO THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO RELOAD OVER THE NEXT 12  MONTHS OR SO BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE DOING SMALLER DEALS BUT WE  WILL BE DOING A FEW PROBABLY. SORKIN: AND WARREN ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS  TALK ABOUT TALENT AND SPECIAL PEOPLE AND SPECIAL BERKSHIRE PEOPLE  AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARK DARE  I ASK THE QUESTION SHOULD WE START TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF  POTENTIAL PEOPLE THAT MAY ONLY RUN THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY NOW  BUT MAYBE PUT INTO THE BERKSHIRE FOLD WHEN IT SOMES TO  SUCCESSION? BUFFETT: IF I READ MARK CORRECTLY AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM  SURE I DO ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS RUN PRECISION AND TO TAKE IT TO  GREATER AND GREATER HEIGHTS HE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN  BERKSHIRE  AND TRUE OF MOST OF OUR MANAGERS THEY LOVE WHAT  THEY ARE DOING THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.  I HAVE TO DECIDE  REALLY WHEN I BUY A COMPANY THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD THAT I  COULD RUN PRECISION OR REALLY ANYBODY IN OUR OPERATION COULD SO  THE FIRST I ASK AND MARK'S 58 I ASK IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS AT 65  THAT HE'S GO AND PLAY SHUFFLE BOARD IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.  AS LONG AS WE TREAT HIM RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO TREAT  PEOPLE RIGHT WE TREAT HIM RIGHT HE WILL BE RUNNING THIS FOR  DECADES AND DECADES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO JUST LIKE I  LIKE RUNNING BERKSHIRE. QUICK: WARREN YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF  THE HUNT FOR A BIG ELEPHANT FOR 12 MONTHS OR SO WHILE THE COMPANY  RELOADS WITH THE CASH  CONTINUALLY COMING IN.  JUST  LAST WEEK BILL ACKMAN MADE IT PUBLIC THAT HE HAS A LARGE STAKE IN  MONDELEZ ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY  MONDELZ GETTING LUMPED IN WITH KRAFT HEINZ.  DOES THAT MEAN  IT IS NOT AN OPTION AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILL'S  PROPOSAL? BUFFETT: WELL I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING MY FRIENDS AT 3G  WANT TO DO BUT WITH KRAFT HEINZ WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US  FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY YOU  NEVER WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT IS QUITE  UNLIKELY THAT KRAFT HEINZ WOULD BE DOING A BIG ACQUISITION IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD I WOULDN'T BE  SURPRISED.  BUT IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY  AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE FOOD COMPANIES SELL AT PRICES THAT IT  WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL EVEN IF WE HAD DONE ALL  OF THE WORK NEEDED AT KRAFT HEINZ.  A LOT OF THE COMPANIES  ARE SELLING AT PRICES THAT SORT OF REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEM  THAT PEOPLE SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT KRAFT HEINZ AND  BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT EASY. QUICK: MEANING THAT MONDELEZ AT THESE PRICES YOU WOULDN'T  LIKE? BUFFETT: WELL IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL THAT  MAKES SENSE YEAH. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE BUT IF  YOU LOOK AT KELLOGG OR CAMPBELL'S SOUP  OR MONDELEZ THEY'RE  PRICES TO SOME EXTENT THE MARKET HAS PUT INTO THOSE COMPANIES  PRICES THAT REFLECT AN EXPECTATION KRAFT HEINZ TYPE MARGINS ARE  POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN IT  ELSEWHERE. SULLIVAN: MR BUFFETT IN 2009 MANY OF THE BANKS CAME TO YOU  FOR HELP. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OIL OR GAS COMPANIES COME TO YOU IN  THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING FOR YOUR HELP, LOOKING FOR YOUR  INVESTMENT? BUFFETT: NOT YET BUT PRICES STAY DOWN HERE.  IF PRICES  STAY DOWN HERE SO FAR I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE  OIL AND GAS BUSINESS UP MAYBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY FELT THAT  OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE BACK.  THEY MAY NOT HAVE FELT GAS  PRICES WOULD BOUNCE MUCH BUT THEY FELT OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE  BACK.  THE OIL PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SELLING ON A  BASIS NOT OF $45 WTI THEY HAVE ASSUMED HIGHER PRICES AND OF  COURSE THE FORWARD CURVE HAVE REFLECTED HIGHER PRICES.  I  THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MAKE REALISTIC DEALS WITH OIL  AND GAS UP UNTIL NOW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE  FUTURE.  TO BE SPECIFIC NOBODY HAS COME TO ME. QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY OTHER  PURCHASES IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS? BUFFETT: THAT'S CORRECT QUICK: SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN ASIDE FROM THIS  DEAL TODAY THAT YOU THINK HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD BUY  INTO? BUFFETT: NO OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF SECENDARY I WOULDN'T  SAY MAYBE 15% OF PRECISION'S BUSINESS HAD BEEN IN THERE AND THEY  GOT HURT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE  WHEN OIL SLOWS DOWN IF THEY'VE GOT VARIOUS BUILDING EQUIPMENT ON  HAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T NEED TO ORDER ANY FOR AWHILE EVEN  THOUGH CONTINUE TO PRODUCE.  SO NO WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY  COMMITMENTS IN OIL AND GAS. SORKIN: HEY WARREN EVERY TIME  I SEE YOU I ALWAYS ASK  THE QUESTION IBM, IBM UPDATE THE STOCK IS TRADING I THINK ABOUT  155 DOLLARS RIGHT ABOUT NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT BUFFETT: I FEEL FINE. SORKIN: WHAT'S YOUR BASIS IN THAT COMPANY AT THIS  POINT? BUFFETT: WHAT'S OUR STOCK COST US? SORKIN: YEH BUFFETT: I WOULD SAY AROUND 170 SORKIN: AROUND 17O NOW BY MY MATH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE  THE MONEY STILL ON THIS DEAL ON PART I THINK THE FUNCTION OF THE  DIVIDENDS BUT YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  STOCK BUFFETT: I LOVE IT WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT MEANS THE COMPANY  BUYS STOCK CHEAPER AND MEANS IF I WANT TO BUY MORE STOCK YOU CAN  LOOK AT OUR 13F IN A FEW DAYS IT MEANS I GET TO BUY IT  CHEAPER QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE BEEN BUYING IT? BUFFETT: I AM NOT A SELLER OF STOCK.  PEOPLE ASSUME  WHEN WE BUY SOME STOCK WE WANT IT TO GO UP.  WE DON'T WANT  IT TO GO UP MAYBE OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY MAYBE FIVE OR TEN YEARS  FROM NOW BUT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPANY BUYING ITS STOCK  CHEAPER. I MEAN THAT'S HAPPENED AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR INSTANCE  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A REGULAR REPURCHASER OF SHARES AND WE OWN  15% OF IT AND OWNERSHIP GOES UP FASTER IF THE STOCK IS DOWN THAN  IF THE STOCK IS UP.  SULLIVAN: WE HAD ON FRIDAY A BILLION DOLLAR ACTIVIST  INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN EXPRESS MR BUFFETT JEFFREY UBEN OF  VALUEACT CAPITAL.  WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK LIKE AN AMERICAN  EXPRESS ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE AN ACTIVIST COME IN DO YOU WELCOME  IT. BUFFETT: NO NOT PARTICULARLY BUT IT IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY  DO WITH THEIR MONEY.  ACTUALLY IT SENDS UP FOUR OR FIVE  POINTS SO THE EXTENT THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS IS REPURCHASING SHARES  WE CAN'T BUY STOCKS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT IS A  BANKHOLDING COMPANY AND WE OWN OVER 10% BUT THE CHEAPER THE STOCK  IS THE MORE SHARES AMERICAN EXPRESS WILL BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE  FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ON BALANCE THAT HELPS US WE'RE  BUYING YOU KNOW THERE IS NO MORAL PROBLEM ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE  IT TAKES PLACE IN THE MARKET BUT WE'RE ON OUR PARTNERS  CHEAPER. QUICK: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO A LOT  CHEAPER THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO YOU LOOKS AT THE MEDIA STOCKS  DISNEY KICKED IT OFF WHEN BOB IGER SAID THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT  ESPN, VERY BRIEF CONCERNS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET TOOK  THAT AS A HUGE SELLING POINT NOT ONLY FOR DISNEY BUT ALL OF THE  MEDIA RELATED STOCKS DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY  YOU LIKE AT THESE PRICES? BUFFETT: NO I WOULD SAY THAT I CONSIDER BOB IGER AND I KNOW  HIM WELL AND HAD EXPERIENCE WITH HIM MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO I  THINK HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MANAGERS IN AMERICA AND A GOOD GUY  BEYOND THAT BUT I'M AN OBSERVER OF THE MEDIA PICTURE TODD AND  TEDD OWN SOME SHARES IN CERTAIN MEDIA STOCKS BUT I AM NO VICTIM  OF THIS MYSELF AND THE SELL OFF DID NOT ENTICE ME. SORKIN: HEY WARREN SPEAKING OF BUYBACKS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU  SENT YOUR LETTER AND WE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW BUT LARRY FINK FROM  BLACKROCK SENT A LETTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO CEOS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND SAID LOOK STOP WITH THE BUYBACKS, STOP WITH THE  DIVIDENDS WE WANT YOU INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND IN PART I WOULD  ARGUE THAT LETTER SEEMED TO INSPIRE HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER  LATEST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM APPROACH AND PROGRAM THAT SHE'S TALK  ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE CAPITAL GAINS  STRUCTURE AROUND INVESTMENTS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO SAY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT LARRY  FINK HAD TO SAY? BUFFETT: WELL PEOPLE MAKE BUYBACKS VERY COMPLICATED.    BUYBACKS MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING YOUR STOCK BACK  BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE AND WHEN YOU DON'T NEED THAT MONEY FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU PAY  ABOVE INTRINSIC VALUE AND THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPAL BUT IT  HAS BEEN IGNORED BY MANY MANAGEMENTS OVER TIME.  IF YOU LOOK  AT THE HISTORY OF BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUYBACK A LOT IN TERMS OF  AGRIGATE BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUY A LOT MORE STOCK BACK WHEN STOCKS  ARE UP THAN WHEN THEY ARE DOWN BUT IN THAT WAY THEY ARE SORT OF  BEHAVING LIKE JOE PUBLIC YOU KNOW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  GREAT INVESTMENT STORIES BASED ON PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT BACK STOCK  INTELLIGENTLY WHICH MEANS BUYING IT AT A DISCOUNT FROM ITS  INTRINSIC VALUE.  WE WOULD BUY BACK STOCK BY THE BUSHELL  BASKETS IF IT SOLD WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE WON'T BUY A SHARE IF WE   THINK WE ARE PAYING INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORE. IT IS NOT A  COMPLICATED EQUATION BUT MANAGEMENTS WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY ARE  GOING TO HAVEA 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK THEY OUGHT TO SAY WE ARE  HAVING A 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK IF WE CAN BUY IT AT X OR BELOW  BUT THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY IT OPERATES. SULLIVAN:  HAS IT BEEN AN EFFICIENT USE OF  CAPITAL BUFFETT: IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFICLY EFFICIENT USE OF CAPITAL  FOR SOME COMPANIES AND BEEN A VERY STUPID USE OF CAPITAL FOR  OTHER COMPANIES.  I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR BUYBACKS HAVE BEEN  PEANUTS UNFORTUNATELY  BUT OUR COUPLE OF BUYBACKS MADE GREAT  SENSE.  BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT ON SCALE.  SORKIN: AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTONS PROPOSAL  ON CAPITAL GAINS BUT SHE ALSO SAID I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTS  PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO BUYBACKS THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY  SHOULD BE REGULATED.  ELIZABETH WARREN  AND OTHERS HAVE  SUGGESTED THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDER TRADING BECAUSE THE  COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT IT. BUFFETT: WELL I WILL BE GLAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT  SOMETIME.  I HAVE WRITTEN ON IT ABOUT 20 TIMES OVER THE  YEARS AND IN GENERAL VERY MUCH APPROVE OF WHERE HILLARY IS GOING  IN TERMS OF FINE TUNING ALL THE POINTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS  THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES.  BUT BUYBACKS ARE NOT NIRVANA AND  THEY ARE NOT EVIL IT IS JUST A QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY MAKE  SENSE AND IF OUR STOCK SELLS WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE  HAVE MONEY WE DON'T NEED FOR THE BUSINESS WE WILL BUY IT BACK  JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHENEVER I SAY THAT IT  KEEPS IT FROM HAPPENING. QUICK: WARREN WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY  CLINTON BUT DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL DEBATES THAT  TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK? BUFFETT: I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT QUICK: AND WHAT DID YOU THINK? BUFFETT: I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIFIC TELEVISION AND I  THINK THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE WITH PROPORTIONAL AWARDING DELEGATES  IN A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIMARIES AND WITH SUPER PACKS ENABLING  PEOPLE TO KEEP GETTING FINANCE WHERE AS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD DROP  OUT FOR LACK OF MONEY IF THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT WELL.  I  THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CHANCE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION NO ONE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY GOING IN BUT I  THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING.  DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DELEGATES AND SO WILL A  WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS AND IN THE PAST UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE TOP  2 OR 3 YOUR FUNDING DRIES UP AND YOU GET TO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND THAT WAS WITH BUT WITH SUPER PACKS AROUND YOU CAN HAVE QUITE  A FEW CANDIDATES IN IT FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND THE PIE COULD  GET DIVIDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY.  IT IS  GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  IT IS A GREAT SPECTATOR  SPORT. QUICK: WE DID HAVE AN OVERNIGHT POLL AN NBC NEWS POLL THAT  WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IT SHOWED THAT DONALD  TRUMP IS STILL LEADING THE PACK WHICH MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO  SOME PUNDITS WHO HAD KIND OF WRITTEN HIM OFF AFTER THAT  PERFORMANCE. BUFFETT: YEH NO HE IF YOU CAN GET BY THE JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT  A HERO AND A FEW THINGS AND NOT HAVE YOUR NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU  HAVE A VERY SOLID BASE AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE  MAINTAINS QUITE A SOLID BASE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT MEANS HE  IS GOING TO GET A FAIR NUMBER OF DELEGATES IF YOU GET IT IN  PROPORTIONAL STATES. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY SO  IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A  DEMOCRAT.  QUICK: I WAS GOING TO SAY AS A DEMOCRAT YOU MUST ENJOY HOW  THIS PLAYS OUT.  WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE YOUR  CANDIDATE RUN AGAINST? BUFFETT: WELL I THINK IF I GAVE THAT PREDICTION IT WOULD BE  SORT OF THE KISS OF DEATH ON THAT CANDIDATE.  I WANT TO SEE  HER RUN AGAINST THE WHOLE FIELD.  QUICK: YOU KNOW WARREN WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER  THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WE SAW THE JOBS NUMBER  THAT CAME IN.  THE JOBS REPORT WAS JUST AS EXPECTED ON  FRIDAY 215,000 A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT THE FED WILL  RAISE INTEREST RATES COME SEPTEMBER.  YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD  IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS  THAT YOU SEE AND THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE  PULSE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY.   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD DO IN SPETEMBER? BUFFETT: I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY IS  EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS THAT IT IS  MOVING AHEAD ROUGHLY AT 2% RATE AND IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A SPURT  OCCASSIONALLY AUTOS ARE STRONG RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY  STEADY INCREASE AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOUBLE DIPS AND  THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ACCELERATION AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT  IT MOVING SHARPLY IN ONE DIRECTION IT DOESN'T DO IT.   THE  ECONOMY HAS COME BACK AND IT HAS COME BACK VERY WELL  CONSIDERING THE KIND OF SHOCK THAT WE HAD 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO BUT I  DON'T SEE IT PARTICULARLY ACCELERATING AND I DON'T SEE IT  DECELERATING EITHER.  I HAVE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT IS VERY  TOUGH TO PUSH RATES HIGHER IN THE U.S. WHEN EUROPE NEEDS TO KEEP  THEM ALL AND YOU'VE GOT THE SITUATION EXISTING AROUND THE WORLD  BUT I KEEP HEARING THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS SAY IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN SOON SO BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS AN EASY DECISION WHEN  RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN EUROPE AND YOU MAY BE AFFECTING  EXPORTS AND IMPORTS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IF YOU PUSH RATES HERE TO  BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THEY EXIST IN EUROPE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET LATELY IF YOU HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAS  BEEN HAPPENING DURING EARNINGS SEASON SOME OF THE MOVES HAVE BEEN  EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING BY SMALL AMOUNTS ON EARNINGS  OR REVENUE LINES AND THEN COMING IN WITH DOUBLE DIGIT STOCK  DECLINES YOU ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MEDIA STOCKS OVERALL  MOVE THE ENTIRE SECTOR LOWER THAT HAS SOME PEOPLE THINKING THAT  THERE IS A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET AND THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A CORRECTION THAT'S DUE.  I AM GUESSING THAT I  WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THAT CAMP IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO DEALS LIKE  THIS OR DO YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A DAY TO DAY  BASIS? BUFFETT: STOCKS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER AND PERHAPS A LOT  HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH  TO PICK TIMES TO GET IN AND GET OUT IF YOU ARE IN SOMETHING THAT  IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER OVER TIME.  IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR  HOUSE WAS GOING TO GO DOWN 5% IN PRICE YOU WOULDN'T SELL YOUR  HOUSE AND HOPE TO BUY IT BACK 5% CHEAPER.  THAT'S NOT MY  GAME.  MY GAME IS TO OWN DECENT BUSINESSES AND OWN THEM AT  DECENT PRICES AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME  IF YOU DO IT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DANCE IN AND  OUT OF MARKETS IS QUITE LIMITED AND IN MY CASE IT IS  ZERO.  QUICK:  WARREN THERE IS A STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY ABOUT COCA COLA WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT  YOU ALSO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN IT POINTS OUT THAT COCA COLA  HAS TEAMED UP WITH SOME INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND ADVANCE  A MESSAGE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS  THAT IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT  HOW MUCH YOU EXERCISE NOT WHAT YOU EAT THAT MATTERS.  THE  TIMES ACTUALLY KIND OF PUTS THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THEY LOOK   ASKANCE THE IDEA THAT BIG COPORATION IS FUNDING A MESSAGE  LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU SAY AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER? BUFFETT:  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WEIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW  MUCH YOU TAKE IN AND HOW MUCH YOU BURN UP.  AND IF YOU TAKE  IN 2700 CALORIES AND YOU BURN UP 2700 YOUR WEIGHT ISN'T GOING TO  CHANGE AND IF YOU TAKE IN 3500 AND BURN 2500 YOU ARE GOING TO  GAIN WEIGHT.  IT'S A MATHEMATICAL TYPE EQUATION AND IF YOU  ARE LIKE ME AND DON'T LIKE TO EXERCISE MUCH THAN YOU BETTER NOT  TAKE IN TOO MUCH.  THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO WEIGHT.   CALORIES ARE DEFINED THERE'S 4 PER GRAM IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH  PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATES THERE'S 9 PER GRAM WITH FAT AND YOU'VE  GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT SO YOUR BODY  BURNS OFF AS MANY AS YOU ARE CONSUMING. QUICK: WELL WARREN WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS  MORNING.  AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON THE DEAL.

QUICK: AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING THROUGH THE NUMBERS ON THIS  DEAL AGAIN IT IS BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY BUYING PRECISION CASTPARTS  THIS IS A DEAL THAT THEY ARE VALUING AT 37 BILLION DOLLARS JUST  LOOKING AT THE PRESS RELEASE.  WARREN BUFFETT IS CALLING  INTO  THE CONTROL ROOM IS JUST A MINUTE THEY ARE PAYING $235  PER SHARE IN CASH THIS IS A STOCK THAT CLOSED AT $193.88 ON  FRIDAY SO WE WILL BE TALKING MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS.  I THINK  RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE WARREN BUFFETT ON THE LINE. SIR ARE YOU  THERE? SO WE SEE THE NEWS THAT IS OUT TODAY THIS COMES AS A  SURPRISE TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL DID  REPORT THIS ON SATURDAY I WONDER WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR ABOUT  THIS, WHEN DID YOU FIRST TALK TO THIS COMPANY AND HOW DID THIS  DEAL HAPPEN? BUFFETT:  I WOULD SAY IS WAS ABOUT 5 WEEKS AGO.   YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO TODD COMBS FOR THE DEAL WE HIRED TODD  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO TO MANAGE MONEY AND HE MANAGES ABOUT 9 BILLION  NOW AND MAYBE THREE OR SO YEARS AGO  HE ADDED PRECISION TO  HIS PORTFOLIO AND I REALLY NEVER HEARD ABOUT THE COMPANY BEFORE  THAT AND TODD TOLD ME A LOT ABOUT IT AND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS  I HAVE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT AND ABOUT 5 OR SO WEEKS AGO THE  CEO MARK DONEGAN ALONG WITH HIS CFO AND IR PERSON CAME BY  BERKSHIRE THEY WERE SEEING BERKSHIRE HOLDERS AND THEY MET WITH  TODD AND THEN I DROPPED IN ON THE VISIT AND IN THE LAST 15  MINUTES OR SO AND I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY MARK AND OF COURSE I  HAD BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE COMPANY SO SHORTLY THEREAFTER I STOPPED  AND GIVE THEM A CALL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE OFFENDED IF WE MADE  A BID AND THEY DIDN'T INDICATE THEY WERE PARTICULARLY RECEPTIVE  BUT THEY ALSO INDICATED THEY WOULD LISTEN SO I SUBSEQUENTLY MADE  A BID. I MET MARK OUT AT SUN VALLEY, HE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AIR  MOST OF THE TIME AND SO HE CAME BY BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR THE  ALLEN COMPANY CONFERENCE AND I MADE HIM A BID AND HE TOOK IT TO  THE BOARD AND BEFORE LONG WE HAD A DEAL. SORKIN:  WARREN I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU I SAW BECKY THE  WEEK AFTER SUN VALLEY AND I SAID BUT WARREN IS DOING A DEAL I HAD  SEEN YOU AT SUN VALLEY. YOU HAD THAT PHONE WITH YOU SO INTENSE  THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON AND I THOUGHT I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS  IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING.  BUFFETT: I WILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN I AM AROUND YOU  ANDREW IF YOU CAN READ MY FACE LIKE THAT.  SORKIN: FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE  HAD FROM AN EBITA I WAS DOING IT OFF OF THE $30 BILLION AND  THINKING THIS WAS ABOUT 20 TIMES EBITA WHICH I WAS SAYING NOT THE  CHEAPEST DEAL IN TOWN.  IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO SPEND A LOT OF  MONEY QUICKLY.  IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION THOUGH HOW DO YOU  THINK ABOUT IT AND WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING THIS KIND  OF MONEY IS IT HARDER AND HARDER AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER  TO ACTUALLY GET A REALLY CHEAP DEAL? BUFFETT: IT IS NOT 20 TIMES EBITA THOUGH ANDREW. I AM NOT  SURE WHAT FIGURES YOU ARE LOOKING AT THERE BUT ALL DEALS SEEM  EXPENSIVE TO ME BUT THIS ONE WE ARE CERTAINLY PAYING A VERY GOOD  PRICE FOR AN EXTRAORDINARY COMPANY RUN BY A PERSON THAN AS FAR AS  I AM CONCERNED HE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT WHAT HE  DOES.  SORKIN: HE'S MADE A NUMBER OF DEALS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF  YEARS ABOUT 8 BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTIONS WHEN YOU LOOK  AT THIS COMPANY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DO YOU IMAGINE  USING A LOT OF BERKSHIRE CASH TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO  USE IT AS A ROLL UP VEHICLE IF YOU WILL? BUFFETT: WELL ITS ALWAYS ACQUIRED COMPANIES I DON'T KNOW  HOW MANY ACQUISITIONS THEY MADE OVER THE YEARS BUT IT IS A LOT.   BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO INTO AEROSPACE IN  THE WAY OF PARTS AND THEY'VE GONE AFTER ONE ITEM AFTER ANOTHER  OVER THE YEARS.  IN FACT THEY'VE MADE A COUPLE SMALL DEALS I  BELIEVE IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER AND I THINK THEY'VE GOT MAYBE  ONE PENDING OR SO.  NOW THEY MAKE A GOOD BIT OF MONEY SO  THEY WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO DO THE ACQUISITIONS OR MANY OF THE  ACQUISITIONS INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS BUT IF THEY NEED ANY  MONEY FROM BERKSHIRE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS CALL.  QUICKLY: WARREN THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE DEAL IS THIS THE MOST  EXPENSIVE DEAL EVER?  HOW DOES IT MATCH UP TO BURLINGTON  NORTHERN? BUFFETT: WELL THE MOST DEALS ARE THE ONES THAT DON'T WORK  OUT.  YOU MENTIONED DEXTER SHOE A LITTLE WHILE AGO. BUT IN  TERMS OF PRICE EARNINGS MULTIPLES GOING IN THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE  AT THE TOP NOW WHEN WE BOUGHT BURLINGTON THAT WAS A HIGH PE BUT  IT WAS OFF A VERY DEPRESSED FIGURE BECAUSE WE BOUGHT THAT IN THE  FALL OF 2009 WHEN EARNINGS WERE AT A TROUGH.  AND PRECISIONS  EARNINGS HAVE FALLEN OFF MODERATELY BECAUSE OF DEVELOPMENTS IN  THE OIL AND GAS FIELD WHERE THEY DO SOME BUSINESS AS WELL AS IN  AEROSPACE SO BUT THIS IS A VERY HIGH MULTIPLE FOR US. SULLIVAN: YOU READ MY MIND ON OIL AND GAS HOW MUCH OF THIS  IF AT ALL IS A BET THAT THE U.S. OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY MAY BE  BOTTOMING OUT AT LEAST FROM A PRICE PERSPECTIVE? BUFFETT: WELL WE ARE GOING TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS FOR A 100  YEARS SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHAT OIL AND GAS  DOES IN THE NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF US BUYING IT.  IF SOMEONE  TOLD ME FOR SURE THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS WAS GOING TO BE IN THE  DULDRUMS WE'LL SAY FOR 3 YEARS I STILL WOULD HAVE MADE THE  DEAL.  THAT'S NOT A PREDICTION I AM JUST SAYING IT IS NOT  IMPORTANT TO US HOW LONG THE OIL AND GAS SLUMP LASTS WHEN YOU GET  A CHANCE TO BUY A WONDERFUL COMPANY YOU KNOW THERE IS USUALLY  SOME REASON WHY YOU ARE GETTING THAT CHANCE AND PERHAPS THE SLUMP  IN OIL AND GAS HELPS US IN THIS CASE.  BUT THERE WILL BE  SOMEDAY THERE WILL BE A SLUMP IN AEROSPACE AND THAT WILL BE MUCH  MORE SEVERE FOR A COMPANY LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU LOOK OVER THE  DECADES BOTH OIL AND GAS AND AEROSPACE WILL BE GOOD BUSINESS AND  THESE FELLOWS ARE THEIR KEY PARTICULARLY IN THE AEROSPACE  BUSINESS THE INDUSTRY NEEDS THEM THEY'RE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS  THE MOST RELIABLE INNOVATIVE  DEPENDABLE SUPPLIER OF VERY  KEY PARTS THAT GO INTO ALL KINDS OF AIRCRAFTS.  SORKIN: WARREN SPEAK TO THE DEFENSIVE MODE THAT YOU OFTEN  TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT PARTICULAR COMPANY IN TERMS OF  ITS MARKETSHARE AND ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN IF NOT GROW THAT  MARKETSHARE BUFFETT:  WELL WHAT YOU NEED IS YOU NEED PEOPLE THAT  HAVE PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT THAT IS A SMALL PART OF IT.   THEY DO HAVE MARVELOUS PHYSICAL FACILITIES BUT WHAT YOU REALLY  NEED IS BRAIN POWER AND YOU NEED PARTICULARLY AT THE TOP YOU NEED  SOMEBODY WITH A TOTAL PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS AND I'VE MET MARK  FOUR OR FIVE TIMES AND EACH TIME HE'S BEEN IN THE AIR AND HE'S IN  THE AIR ALMOST A THOUSAND HOURS A YEAR THIS FELLOW LOVES THIS  BUSINESS LIKE I LOVE BERKSHIRE AND HE'S A LOT BETTER AT IT THAN I  AM AT BERKSHIRE. YOU CAN'T FIND PEOPLE LIKE THIS.  YOU  CERTAINLY CAN'T HIRE THEM.  THE ONE THING I GUARANTEE MARK  IS THAT HE'S RUNNING THE COMPANY.  PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE VERY  VERY RARE.  YOU CAN SEE IT IN WHAT HE HAS BUILT AND YOU CAN  SEE IT IN THE PASSION HE'S GOT FOR WHAT HE IS DOING NOW.   HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF GETTING MORE BUSINESS IN THE  AIRFRAME AND THE ENGINES.  HE'S NEVER SATISFIED IN TERMS OF  GETTING HIS COST TO WHERE THEY SHOULD BE.  HE JUST HAS A  PASSION FOR THE BUSINESS. QUICK:  WARREN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IN TERMS OF THE  CASH THAT YOU ARE USING FOR THIS?  I KNOW YOU LIKE TO KEEP  ABOUT 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH ON HAND.  ARE YOU STILL IN  THE MARKET FOR OTHER POTENTIAL DEALS? OR DOES THIS TAKE YOU OUT  OF THE MARKET FOR AWHILE? BUFFETT: THIS TAKES US OUT OF THE MARKET FOR AN ELEPHANT  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY BE BUYING A FEW SMALL THINGS IN THE NEXT 6  MONTHS.  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A COUPLE BUT IN TERMS OF  A DEAL OF SIMILAR SIZE IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES US OUT.  WHAT WE  WILL PROBABLY DO ON THIS ONE WE WILL PROBABLY BORROW ABOUT 10  BILLION AND USE ABOUT 23 BILLION OF OUR OWN CASH ON THAT  ORDER.  WE'LL BE LEFT WITH OVER 40 BILLION PROBABLY IN CASH  WHEN WE GET ALL THROUGH.  BUT I LIKE TO HAVE A LOT OF CASH  AT ALL TIMES SO THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO RELOAD OVER THE NEXT 12  MONTHS OR SO BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE DOING SMALLER DEALS BUT WE  WILL BE DOING A FEW PROBABLY. SORKIN: AND WARREN ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU ALWAYS  TALK ABOUT TALENT AND SPECIAL PEOPLE AND SPECIAL BERKSHIRE PEOPLE  AND IT IS HARD TO FIND THEM.  WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MARK DARE  I ASK THE QUESTION SHOULD WE START TO ADD HIM TO THE LIST OF  POTENTIAL PEOPLE THAT MAY ONLY RUN THIS PARTICULAR COMPANY NOW  BUT MAYBE PUT INTO THE BERKSHIRE FOLD WHEN IT SOMES TO  SUCCESSION? BUFFETT: IF I READ MARK CORRECTLY AND IN THIS RESPECT I AM  SURE I DO ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS RUN PRECISION AND TO TAKE IT TO  GREATER AND GREATER HEIGHTS HE DOES NOT WANT TO RUN  BERKSHIRE  AND TRUE OF MOST OF OUR MANAGERS THEY LOVE WHAT  THEY ARE DOING THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.  I HAVE TO DECIDE  REALLY WHEN I BUY A COMPANY THERE IS NO WAY IN THE WORLD THAT I  COULD RUN PRECISION OR REALLY ANYBODY IN OUR OPERATION COULD SO  THE FIRST I ASK AND MARK'S 58 I ASK IF HE HAS ANY IDEAS AT 65  THAT HE'S GO AND PLAY SHUFFLE BOARD IN FLORIDA OR SOMETHING LIKE  THAT.  AS LONG AS WE TREAT HIM RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT TO TREAT  PEOPLE RIGHT WE TREAT HIM RIGHT HE WILL BE RUNNING THIS FOR  DECADES AND DECADES. AND THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO JUST LIKE I  LIKE RUNNING BERKSHIRE. QUICK: WARREN YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS WILL TAKE YOU OUT OF  THE HUNT FOR A BIG ELEPHANT FOR 12 MONTHS OR SO WHILE THE COMPANY  RELOADS WITH THE CASH  CONTINUALLY COMING IN.  JUST  LAST WEEK BILL ACKMAN MADE IT PUBLIC THAT HE HAS A LARGE STAKE IN  MONDELEZ ONE OF THE THINGS HE THOUGHT ABOUT IS POTENTIALLY  MONDELZ GETTING LUMPED IN WITH KRAFT HEINZ.  DOES THAT MEAN  IT IS NOT AN OPTION AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BILL'S  PROPOSAL? BUFFETT: WELL I WILL LISTEN TO ANYTHING MY FRIENDS AT 3G  WANT TO DO BUT WITH KRAFT HEINZ WE HAVE OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US  FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I THINK IT IS QUITE UNLIKELY YOU  NEVER WANT TO SAY ANYTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE BUT I THINK IT IS QUITE  UNLIKELY THAT KRAFT HEINZ WOULD BE DOING A BIG ACQUISITION IN THE  NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS SOMEWHERE DOWN THE ROAD I WOULDN'T BE  SURPRISED.  BUT IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY  AND FRANKLY MOST OF THE FOOD COMPANIES SELL AT PRICES THAT IT  WOULD BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL EVEN IF WE HAD DONE ALL  OF THE WORK NEEDED AT KRAFT HEINZ.  A LOT OF THE COMPANIES  ARE SELLING AT PRICES THAT SORT OF REFLECT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEM  THAT PEOPLE SORT OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT KRAFT HEINZ AND  BELIEVE ME THIS IS NOT EASY. QUICK: MEANING THAT MONDELEZ AT THESE PRICES YOU WOULDN'T  LIKE? BUFFETT: WELL IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO MAKE A DEAL THAT  MAKES SENSE YEAH. BUT WHO KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE BUT IF  YOU LOOK AT KELLOGG OR CAMPBELL'S SOUP  OR MONDELEZ THEY'RE  PRICES TO SOME EXTENT THE MARKET HAS PUT INTO THOSE COMPANIES  PRICES THAT REFLECT AN EXPECTATION KRAFT HEINZ TYPE MARGINS ARE  POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY BE THE CASE BUT I HAVE NOT SEEN IT  ELSEWHERE. SULLIVAN: MR BUFFETT IN 2009 MANY OF THE BANKS CAME TO YOU  FOR HELP. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OIL OR GAS COMPANIES COME TO YOU IN  THE LAST FEW MONTHS LOOKING FOR YOUR HELP, LOOKING FOR YOUR  INVESTMENT? BUFFETT: NOT YET BUT PRICES STAY DOWN HERE.  IF PRICES  STAY DOWN HERE SO FAR I WOULD SAY THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE  OIL AND GAS BUSINESS UP MAYBE UNTIL VERY RECENTLY THEY FELT THAT  OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE BACK.  THEY MAY NOT HAVE FELT GAS  PRICES WOULD BOUNCE MUCH BUT THEY FELT OIL PRICES WOULD BOUNCE  BACK.  THE OIL PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SELLING ON A  BASIS NOT OF $45 WTI THEY HAVE ASSUMED HIGHER PRICES AND OF  COURSE THE FORWARD CURVE HAVE REFLECTED HIGHER PRICES.  I  THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MAKE REALISTIC DEALS WITH OIL  AND GAS UP UNTIL NOW BUT WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE  FUTURE.  TO BE SPECIFIC NOBODY HAS COME TO ME. QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY OTHER  PURCHASES IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS? BUFFETT: THAT'S CORRECT QUICK: SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU'VE SEEN ASIDE FROM THIS  DEAL TODAY THAT YOU THINK HAS BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD BUY  INTO? BUFFETT: NO OF COURSE THIS IS KIND OF SECENDARY I WOULDN'T  SAY MAYBE 15% OF PRECISION'S BUSINESS HAD BEEN IN THERE AND THEY  GOT HURT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF QUARTERS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE  WHEN OIL SLOWS DOWN IF THEY'VE GOT VARIOUS BUILDING EQUIPMENT ON  HAND ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T NEED TO ORDER ANY FOR AWHILE EVEN  THOUGH CONTINUE TO PRODUCE.  SO NO WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY  COMMITMENTS IN OIL AND GAS. SORKIN: HEY WARREN EVERY TIME  I SEE YOU I ALWAYS ASK  THE QUESTION IBM, IBM UPDATE THE STOCK IS TRADING I THINK ABOUT  155 DOLLARS RIGHT ABOUT NOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT BUFFETT: I FEEL FINE. SORKIN: WHAT'S YOUR BASIS IN THAT COMPANY AT THIS  POINT? BUFFETT: WHAT'S OUR STOCK COST US? SORKIN: YEH BUFFETT: I WOULD SAY AROUND 170 SORKIN: AROUND 17O NOW BY MY MATH YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MADE  THE MONEY STILL ON THIS DEAL ON PART I THINK THE FUNCTION OF THE  DIVIDENDS BUT YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL IN TERMS OF THE  STOCK BUFFETT: I LOVE IT WHEN IT GOES DOWN IT MEANS THE COMPANY  BUYS STOCK CHEAPER AND MEANS IF I WANT TO BUY MORE STOCK YOU CAN  LOOK AT OUR 13F IN A FEW DAYS IT MEANS I GET TO BUY IT  CHEAPER QUICK: DOES THAT MEAN YOU'VE BEEN BUYING IT? BUFFETT: I AM NOT A SELLER OF STOCK.  PEOPLE ASSUME  WHEN WE BUY SOME STOCK WE WANT IT TO GO UP.  WE DON'T WANT  IT TO GO UP MAYBE OBVIOUSLY EVENTUALLY MAYBE FIVE OR TEN YEARS  FROM NOW BUT WE LOVE THE IDEA OF A COMPANY BUYING ITS STOCK  CHEAPER. I MEAN THAT'S HAPPENED AT AMERICAN EXPRESS FOR INSTANCE  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A REGULAR REPURCHASER OF SHARES AND WE OWN  15% OF IT AND OWNERSHIP GOES UP FASTER IF THE STOCK IS DOWN THAN  IF THE STOCK IS UP.  SULLIVAN: WE HAD ON FRIDAY A BILLION DOLLAR ACTIVIST  INVESTMENT IN AMERICAN EXPRESS MR BUFFETT JEFFREY UBEN OF  VALUEACT CAPITAL.  WHEN YOU OWN A STOCK LIKE AN AMERICAN  EXPRESS ARE YOU HAPPY TO SEE AN ACTIVIST COME IN DO YOU WELCOME  IT. BUFFETT: NO NOT PARTICULARLY BUT IT IS UP TO THEM WHAT THEY  DO WITH THEIR MONEY.  ACTUALLY IT SENDS UP FOUR OR FIVE  POINTS SO THE EXTENT THAT AMERICAN EXPRESS IS REPURCHASING SHARES  WE CAN'T BUY STOCKS IN AMERICAN EXPRESS BECAUSE IT IS A  BANKHOLDING COMPANY AND WE OWN OVER 10% BUT THE CHEAPER THE STOCK  IS THE MORE SHARES AMERICAN EXPRESS WILL BE ABLE TO REPURCHASE  FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND ON BALANCE THAT HELPS US WE'RE  BUYING YOU KNOW THERE IS NO MORAL PROBLEM ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE  IT TAKES PLACE IN THE MARKET BUT WE'RE ON OUR PARTNERS  CHEAPER. QUICK: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO A LOT  CHEAPER THAN IT WAS A WEEK AGO YOU LOOKS AT THE MEDIA STOCKS  DISNEY KICKED IT OFF WHEN BOB IGER SAID THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT  ESPN, VERY BRIEF CONCERNS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE THE MARKET TOOK  THAT AS A HUGE SELLING POINT NOT ONLY FOR DISNEY BUT ALL OF THE  MEDIA RELATED STOCKS DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE MEDIA INDUSTRY  YOU LIKE AT THESE PRICES? BUFFETT: NO I WOULD SAY THAT I CONSIDER BOB IGER AND I KNOW  HIM WELL AND HAD EXPERIENCE WITH HIM MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO I  THINK HE IS ONE OF THE GREAT MANAGERS IN AMERICA AND A GOOD GUY  BEYOND THAT BUT I'M AN OBSERVER OF THE MEDIA PICTURE TODD AND  TEDD OWN SOME SHARES IN CERTAIN MEDIA STOCKS BUT I AM NO VICTIM  OF THIS MYSELF AND THE SELL OFF DID NOT ENTICE ME. SORKIN: HEY WARREN SPEAKING OF BUYBACKS ONE OF THE  QUESTIONS AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SINCE YOU  SENT YOUR LETTER AND WE HAD YOU ON THE SHOW BUT LARRY FINK FROM  BLACKROCK SENT A LETTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO CEOS AROUND THE  COUNTRY AND SAID LOOK STOP WITH THE BUYBACKS, STOP WITH THE  DIVIDENDS WE WANT YOU INVESTING IN THE FUTURE AND IN PART I WOULD  ARGUE THAT LETTER SEEMED TO INSPIRE HILLARY CLINTON WITH HER  LATEST QUARTERLY CAPITALISM APPROACH AND PROGRAM THAT SHE'S TALK  ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE TAX STRUCTURE CAPITAL GAINS  STRUCTURE AROUND INVESTMENTS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT  HILLARY CLINTON HAD TO SAY AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT LARRY  FINK HAD TO SAY? BUFFETT: WELL PEOPLE MAKE BUYBACKS VERY COMPLICATED.    BUYBACKS MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING YOUR STOCK BACK  BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE AND WHEN YOU DON'T NEED THAT MONEY FOR  THE NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE WHEN YOU PAY  ABOVE INTRINSIC VALUE AND THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE PRINCIPAL BUT IT  HAS BEEN IGNORED BY MANY MANAGEMENTS OVER TIME.  IF YOU LOOK  AT THE HISTORY OF BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUYBACK A LOT IN TERMS OF  AGRIGATE BUYBACKS PEOPLE BUY A LOT MORE STOCK BACK WHEN STOCKS  ARE UP THAN WHEN THEY ARE DOWN BUT IN THAT WAY THEY ARE SORT OF  BEHAVING LIKE JOE PUBLIC YOU KNOW.  THERE HAVE BEEN SOME  GREAT INVESTMENT STORIES BASED ON PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT BACK STOCK  INTELLIGENTLY WHICH MEANS BUYING IT AT A DISCOUNT FROM ITS  INTRINSIC VALUE.  WE WOULD BUY BACK STOCK BY THE BUSHELL  BASKETS IF IT SOLD WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE  WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE WON'T BUY A SHARE IF WE   THINK WE ARE PAYING INTRINSIC VALUE OR MORE. IT IS NOT A  COMPLICATED EQUATION BUT MANAGEMENTS WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS THEY ARE  GOING TO HAVEA 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK THEY OUGHT TO SAY WE ARE  HAVING A 5 BILLION DOLLAR BUYBACK IF WE CAN BUY IT AT X OR BELOW  BUT THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY IT OPERATES. SULLIVAN:  HAS IT BEEN AN EFFICIENT USE OF  CAPITAL BUFFETT: IT HAS BEEN A TERRIFICLY EFFICIENT USE OF CAPITAL  FOR SOME COMPANIES AND BEEN A VERY STUPID USE OF CAPITAL FOR  OTHER COMPANIES.  I WOULD ARGUE THAT OUR BUYBACKS HAVE BEEN  PEANUTS UNFORTUNATELY  BUT OUR COUPLE OF BUYBACKS MADE GREAT  SENSE.  BUT WE COULDN'T DO IT ON SCALE.  SORKIN: AND WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF HILLARY CLINTONS PROPOSAL  ON CAPITAL GAINS BUT SHE ALSO SAID I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTS  PEOPLE TO LOOK INTO BUYBACKS THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF HOW THEY  SHOULD BE REGULATED.  ELIZABETH WARREN  AND OTHERS HAVE  SUGGESTED THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY INSIDER TRADING BECAUSE THE  COMPANIES KNOW ABOUT IT. BUFFETT: WELL I WILL BE GLAD TO WRITE A PAPER ON IT  SOMETIME.  I HAVE WRITTEN ON IT ABOUT 20 TIMES OVER THE  YEARS AND IN GENERAL VERY MUCH APPROVE OF WHERE HILLARY IS GOING  IN TERMS OF FINE TUNING ALL THE POINTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AS  THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES.  BUT BUYBACKS ARE NOT NIRVANA AND  THEY ARE NOT EVIL IT IS JUST A QUESTION OR WHETHER THEY MAKE  SENSE AND IF OUR STOCK SELLS WELL BELOW INTRINSIC VALUE AND WE  HAVE MONEY WE DON'T NEED FOR THE BUSINESS WE WILL BUY IT BACK  JUST AS FAST AS WE CAN NOW UNFORTUNATELY WHENEVER I SAY THAT IT  KEEPS IT FROM HAPPENING. QUICK: WARREN WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A SUPPORTER OF HILLARY  CLINTON BUT DID YOU WATCH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL DEBATES THAT  TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK? BUFFETT: I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED IT QUICK: AND WHAT DID YOU THINK? BUFFETT: I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TERRIFIC TELEVISION AND I  THINK THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE WITH PROPORTIONAL AWARDING DELEGATES  IN A GREAT MANY OF THE PRIMARIES AND WITH SUPER PACKS ENABLING  PEOPLE TO KEEP GETTING FINANCE WHERE AS OTHERWISE THEY WOULD DROP  OUT FOR LACK OF MONEY IF THEY WEREN'T DOING THAT WELL.  I  THINK THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME CHANCE THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE  REPUBLICAN CONVENTION NO ONE WILL HAVE A MAJORITY GOING IN BUT I  THINK IT WILL BE VERY VERY INTERESTING.  DONALD TRUMP IS  GOING TO HAVE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DELEGATES AND SO WILL A  WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHERS AND IN THE PAST UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE TOP  2 OR 3 YOUR FUNDING DRIES UP AND YOU GET TO A COUPLE OF STATES  AND THAT WAS WITH BUT WITH SUPER PACKS AROUND YOU CAN HAVE QUITE  A FEW CANDIDATES IN IT FOR QUITE A BIT OF TIME AND THE PIE COULD  GET DIVIDED IN SUCH A WAY THAT NOBODY HAS A MAJORITY.  IT IS  GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING.  IT IS A GREAT SPECTATOR  SPORT. QUICK: WE DID HAVE AN OVERNIGHT POLL AN NBC NEWS POLL THAT  WAS CONDUCTED FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IT SHOWED THAT DONALD  TRUMP IS STILL LEADING THE PACK WHICH MIGHT COME AS A SURPRISE TO  SOME PUNDITS WHO HAD KIND OF WRITTEN HIM OFF AFTER THAT  PERFORMANCE. BUFFETT: YEH NO HE IF YOU CAN GET BY THE JOHN MCCAIN IS NOT  A HERO AND A FEW THINGS AND NOT HAVE YOUR NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU  HAVE A VERY SOLID BASE AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HE  MAINTAINS QUITE A SOLID BASE FOR A LONG TIME. AND THAT MEANS HE  IS GOING TO GET A FAIR NUMBER OF DELEGATES IF YOU GET IT IN  PROPORTIONAL STATES. AND HE IS NOT GOING TO RUN OUT OF MONEY SO  IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF FUN TO WATCH PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A  DEMOCRAT.  QUICK: I WAS GOING TO SAY AS A DEMOCRAT YOU MUST ENJOY HOW  THIS PLAYS OUT.  WHO WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE YOUR  CANDIDATE RUN AGAINST? BUFFETT: WELL I THINK IF I GAVE THAT PREDICTION IT WOULD BE  SORT OF THE KISS OF DEATH ON THAT CANDIDATE.  I WANT TO SEE  HER RUN AGAINST THE WHOLE FIELD.  QUICK: YOU KNOW WARREN WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER  THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WE SAW THE JOBS NUMBER  THAT CAME IN.  THE JOBS REPORT WAS JUST AS EXPECTED ON  FRIDAY 215,000 A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECULATING THAT THE FED WILL  RAISE INTEREST RATES COME SEPTEMBER.  YOU HAVE A VERY GOOD  IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY JUST BASED ON THE NUMBERS  THAT YOU SEE AND THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER ON THE  PULSE.  WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY.   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD DO IN SPETEMBER? BUFFETT: I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY IS  EXACTLY WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING NOW FOR FIVE YEARS IS THAT IT IS  MOVING AHEAD ROUGHLY AT 2% RATE AND IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES A SPURT  OCCASSIONALLY AUTOS ARE STRONG RIGHT NOW BUT IT HAS BEEN A VERY  STEADY INCREASE AND PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOUBLE DIPS AND  THEY'VE TALKED ABOUT ACCELERATION AND EVERY TIME THEY TALK ABOUT  IT MOVING SHARPLY IN ONE DIRECTION IT DOESN'T DO IT.   THE  ECONOMY HAS COME BACK AND IT HAS COME BACK VERY WELL  CONSIDERING THE KIND OF SHOCK THAT WE HAD 5 OR 6 YEARS AGO BUT I  DON'T SEE IT PARTICULARLY ACCELERATING AND I DON'T SEE IT  DECELERATING EITHER.  I HAVE SAID BEFORE I THINK IT IS VERY  TOUGH TO PUSH RATES HIGHER IN THE U.S. WHEN EUROPE NEEDS TO KEEP  THEM ALL AND YOU'VE GOT THE SITUATION EXISTING AROUND THE WORLD  BUT I KEEP HEARING THE VARIOUS GOVERNORS SAY IT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN SOON SO BUT I DON'T THINK IT IS AN EASY DECISION WHEN  RATES ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER IN EUROPE AND YOU MAY BE AFFECTING  EXPORTS AND IMPORTS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IF YOU PUSH RATES HERE TO  BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN THEY EXIST IN EUROPE. QUICK: THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN  CONCERNED ABOUT THE MARKET LATELY IF YOU HAVE WATCHED WHAT HAS  BEEN HAPPENING DURING EARNINGS SEASON SOME OF THE MOVES HAVE BEEN  EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE PEOPLE MISSING BY SMALL AMOUNTS ON EARNINGS  OR REVENUE LINES AND THEN COMING IN WITH DOUBLE DIGIT STOCK  DECLINES YOU ALSO SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH MEDIA STOCKS OVERALL  MOVE THE ENTIRE SECTOR LOWER THAT HAS SOME PEOPLE THINKING THAT  THERE IS A LOT OF WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET AND THAT THERE IS  SOMETHING OF A CORRECTION THAT'S DUE.  I AM GUESSING THAT I  WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THAT CAMP IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO DEALS LIKE  THIS OR DO YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON A DAY TO DAY  BASIS? BUFFETT: STOCKS ARE GOING TO BE HIGHER AND PERHAPS A LOT  HIGHER 10 YEARS FROM NOW, 20 YEARS FROM NOW I AM NOT SMART ENOUGH  TO PICK TIMES TO GET IN AND GET OUT IF YOU ARE IN SOMETHING THAT  IS GOING TO BE A LOT HIGHER OVER TIME.  IF YOU THOUGHT YOUR  HOUSE WAS GOING TO GO DOWN 5% IN PRICE YOU WOULDN'T SELL YOUR  HOUSE AND HOPE TO BUY IT BACK 5% CHEAPER.  THAT'S NOT MY  GAME.  MY GAME IS TO OWN DECENT BUSINESSES AND OWN THEM AT  DECENT PRICES AND YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OVER TIME  IF YOU DO IT BUT I THINK THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO DANCE IN AND  OUT OF MARKETS IS QUITE LIMITED AND IN MY CASE IT IS  ZERO.  QUICK:  WARREN THERE IS A STORY ON THE FRONT PAGE OF  THE NEW YORK TIMES TODAY ABOUT COCA COLA WHICH IS A COMPANY THAT  YOU ALSO THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER IN IT POINTS OUT THAT COCA COLA  HAS TEAMED UP WITH SOME INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS TO TRY AND ADVANCE  A MESSAGE IN MEDICAL JOURNALS  THAT IT IS REALLY MORE ABOUT  HOW MUCH YOU EXERCISE NOT WHAT YOU EAT THAT MATTERS.  THE  TIMES ACTUALLY KIND OF PUTS THIS AS SOMETHING WHERE THEY LOOK   ASKANCE THE IDEA THAT BIG COPORATION IS FUNDING A MESSAGE  LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU SAY AS THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER? BUFFETT:  WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WEIGHT DEPENDS ON HOW  MUCH YOU TAKE IN AND HOW MUCH YOU BURN UP.  AND IF YOU TAKE  IN 2700 CALORIES AND YOU BURN UP 2700 YOUR WEIGHT ISN'T GOING TO  CHANGE AND IF YOU TAKE IN 3500 AND BURN 2500 YOU ARE GOING TO  GAIN WEIGHT.  IT'S A MATHEMATICAL TYPE EQUATION AND IF YOU  ARE LIKE ME AND DON'T LIKE TO EXERCISE MUCH THAN YOU BETTER NOT  TAKE IN TOO MUCH.  THERE IS NO MYSTERY TO WEIGHT.   CALORIES ARE DEFINED THERE'S 4 PER GRAM IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH  PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATES THERE'S 9 PER GRAM WITH FAT AND YOU'VE  GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT SO YOUR BODY  BURNS OFF AS MANY AS YOU ARE CONSUMING.

388,Trump's options on emergency funding for the border range from a fight over a few miles of fence to a bruising constitutional war over a wall,2019-01-08T15:36:11+0000,John Harwood,"As the White House descends further into chaos, no one can discern President Donald Trump's next move until he makes it.But Trump and administration aides have signaled that he views a presidential declaration of emergency as an exit ramp from the standoff with Congress that has shut down a large chunk of the government for 18 days now. It would, simultaneously, let him assent to reopening federal agencies and assert unilateral authority to order construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Bracing for Trump's decision, congressional aides in both parties say the potential scope of presidential action ranges from very big to very small.A president's authority to declare a national emergency gives him the power to redirect taxpayer funds Congress has already approved. In conversations with lawmakers, the White House has pointed toward two different pots of Pentagon money. One, containing less than $1 billion, is for curtailing drug shipments. The other, containing $22 billion, is for military construction projects.The military construction pot might even be enough to pay for whatever barrier Trump wants across the 2,000-mile border, whether constructed of concrete or steel or something else. If Trump goes big, he could announce his intention to do exactly that.Yet the bigger he goes, the bigger the backlash he risks.An emergency declaration related to border control would face immediate legal challenges, just as his attempt to ban travel into the United States from some majority-Muslim countries did. The more miles of wall Trump attempts to build under an emergency declaration, the more potential challengers — Congress, private landowners, affected local governments.Moreover, a recent 17-page report to Congress shows that the pot of military construction money contains funds previously designated for projects across the country. That would ensure resistance from both red and blue states eager for those projects. And at a time when Trump speaks openly about the prospect of impeachment proceedings, the weak factual basis for a border emergency claim would invite House Democrats to assert an unconstitutional abuse of executive power.But a little-noticed administration maneuver last fall points to a far more limited possibility.It could be completed by only touching the small pot of anti-drug money. It wouldn't require diverting cash from military construction projects elsewhere. It would only affect 31 miles of the Mexican border on a federal explosives-testing site in Arizona.Last fall, the Pentagon informed Congress that the Navy had committed $7.5 million to ""advance planning and survey efforts"" for new and improved border barriers on the Barry M. Goldwater Range. Calling the range ""a known drug-smuggling corridor,"" Assistant Defense Secretary Kenneth Rapuano wrote that such barriers ""will both protect BMGR from such illegal activity and address human life and safety concerns by deterring unlawful entry onto an active bombing range.""In an October letter to Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, who now chairs the House Armed Services Committee, Rapuano said no construction had occurred on the range. But he noted that the administration was ""reviewing its authority and funding options.""Expressing strong opposition, Smith and his Democratic colleagues estimated that the 31 miles' worth of barrier along the range would cost $450 million. The anti-drug account that the Pentagon might try to tap contains $760 million, according to a Republican congressional aide.Trump has the opportunity to clarify his intentions in a televised prime-time address on the issue Tuesday. If recent form holds, lawmakers will find out at the same time everyone else does.","cnbc, Articles, Donald Trump, Congress, Politics, Washington DC, White House, Government Shutdown, US Economy, US: News, Republicans, Democrats, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","As the White House descends further into chaos, no one can discern President Donald Trump's next move until he makes it.But Trump and administration aides have signaled that he views a presidential declaration of emergency as an exit ramp from the standoff with Congress that has shut down a large chunk of the government for 18 days now.

""Volatility can quickly revert to 'normal' levels as we saw yesterday.

Tariffs could trigger a trade war with a country that is the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports. Even if they don't, the designation would instantly set back relations with Asia's emerging superpower.The U.S. seeks Chinese cooperation on international hot spots, such as North Korea and Iran, and wants to narrow differences over how to handle maritime territorial disputes in East Asia.Given the potential repercussions, some foreign policy experts doubt Romney would carry out the currency threat. Other presidential candidates have made similar promises in order to appeal to voters who have seen manufacturing jobs migrate to China. But, once elected, they soften their approach.""There's probably been wisdom in administrations in the past, Republican and Democrat, of not wanting to go there,"" said Jon Huntsman, who served as President Barack Obama's first ambassador to China before a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.But the commitment to act on Inauguration Day doesn't appear to leave much room to back down.Romney has also taken aim at Obama's ""pivot"" to Asia _ a strategy of deploying more forces and shoring up U.S. alliances there, in part to counter China's military buildup.In a speech this week, Romney said China's recent assertiveness was ""sending chills through the region."" He said the pivot is under-resourced and has alienated U.S. allies elsewhere. He outlined plans to expand U.S. naval power _ although it's unclear how he'd pay for it since he also wants to slash government spending.""What we have seen from the Obama administration has been acquiescence to China, not just on trade issues and currency issues, but on issues of security and human rights,"" said Romney foreign policy adviser Alex Wong.

Wong said that would encourage the peaceful resolution of the region's many maritime territorial disputes, including one flaring between U.S. ally Japan and China over islands both claim. He said Romney would make clear it has a treaty alliance with Japan that covers the islands and has the naval power to back it up.Those plans, though, could take years to implement. Addressing the currency issue on Day One would immediately affect relations.Romney says he would designate China as a manipulator unless it stops currency manipulation by his January inauguration. Romney trade policy adviser Oren Cass said this would set a new tone and show the U.S. is willing to take China to task over a range of trade violations, including intellectual property theft and restrictions on market access for U.S. companies in China.The designation itself would not mandate any sanctions, but would require that the U.S. hold consultations with China.Cass said that if Beijing doesn't move toward changing its currency policies after consultations, the U.S. could impose so-called countervailing duties on Chinese products.But Matthew Goodman, former director of international economics in the National Security Council under Obama, said the U.S. discretion to unilaterally impose retaliatory tariffs ended when it joined the World Trade Organization in 1995, and in practice it is difficult to take a currency dispute to the WTO for settlement. Cass says that under domestic law, the U.S. could impose countervailing duties, and it's an open legal question at the WTO whether member states can do so unilaterally to compensate for a currency subsidy.How China would respond may be swayed by its leadership transition. The new guard would not want to appear weak. But neither would China want the dispute to escalate as it relies on exports and faces its own economic slowdown. If that translates into major job losses at home it could affect social stability, which is Beijing's biggest concern.Obama has consistently opted against designation of China as a currency manipulator. Like President George W. Bush before him, he has preferred to wait while economic forces encourage Beijing to allow its currency to strengthen _ which it has done, although most economists still believe it is undervalued.The Treasury is due to make its next six-month assessment on Monday, although it's not yet clear if it will be announced on that date.

Cass says that under domestic law, the U.S. could impose countervailing duties, and it's an open legal question at the WTO whether member states can do so unilaterally to compensate for a currency subsidy.How China would respond may be swayed by its leadership transition. The new guard would not want to appear weak. But neither would China want the dispute to escalate as it relies on exports and faces its own economic slowdown. If that translates into major job losses at home it could affect social stability, which is Beijing's biggest concern.Obama has consistently opted against designation of China as a currency manipulator. Like President George W. Bush before him, he has preferred to wait while economic forces encourage Beijing to allow its currency to strengthen _ which it has done, although most economists still believe it is undervalued.The Treasury is due to make its next six-month assessment on Monday, although it's not yet clear if it will be announced on that date.

Analysts had lofty expectations for Poseley, who joined up a  couple months ahead of new chief executive Laurent Potvin, and  shares in the yogawear maker, which plunged through the end of  2013, climbed back up in 2014.  But supply-chain woes, concerns over dwindling margins and  another recall has pushed the stock back down in recent  months.  Lululemon, which said the leadership changes are aimed at  reinforcing its brand, also announced a new creative director  role, geared at bringing the design of the men's and women's  product lines under the same organizational umbrella.  Lee Holman, who joined Lululemon in 2014 from Nike, was named to  the newly-created executive vice president, creative director  post.  Chief Financial Officer Stuart Haselden will gain broader  responsibilities, including heading up operations, and the  company has also created a new, still unfilled, chief supply  chain officer role.  Analysts last month questioned Lululemon's margins, which have  dwindled as the company has faced higher costs associated with  its international expansion.

Whether at home or abroad, politicians don’t really need me to identify new problems – they have enough of those. But where can I match my passion for a cause with some constructive ideas? I think it’s worth talking about. Here’s the problem.Both the US and UK economies rely too heavily on selling services. Financial services in particular, as the last two years have shown very dramatically. We all know that many products can be made cheaper and faster overseas. But now the large manufacturers such as China, India and South Korea are moving up the value chain. The threat is no longer low-cost manufacturing; it’s high-tech and ideas. And the proof? As of this year, China has overtaken Germany as the world’s biggest exporter. And it’s not limited to less expensive products. So, why have I decided on now to bang the drum? Well, now is the opportunity for change: we’re coming out of recession; our service-dependency has hurt us badly; and in the UK, there’s nothing like an election year to focus the minds of those who can change things. In the UK, I’ve just produced a reportto help shape politicians’ thinking. The Conservatives have backed it and I’m hoping others will take my ideas on board. It’s about inspiring, supporting and investing to make best use of some superb resources already at our disposal. It’s not, however, about a quick fix, having an idea is easy, but making it work takes time. The UK has a highly motivated workforce; the universities and academics are fantastic. We don’t always make the most of these - of which science and engineering are at the heart. I hope some of the ideas in Ingenious Britaincan be explored in the United States, too – as a society, a greater understanding of the importance of engineering; and a commitment to programs that excite students about science, math and technology. From primary school pupils to graduates, teachers to government, we need more people to take up science, engineering and design. These are exciting and rewarding careers which can contribute hugely to our society and our economy. Government needs to take the lead in steering our brightest and best in this direction. Educators should look again at how universities are funded and assessed. These places need the freedom and flexibility to identify what students and industry wants – such as shorter courses with industry experience. Potential science and engineering undergraduates need more access to industrial scholarships. Student loans might be written off. Postgraduates should be paid properly for their research. Further down the line, access to capital is crucial. Government must examine better routes for debt financing to reach high tech companies. If possible, this should involve using the power of government guarantees to encourage lenders – existing banks or new entrants – to extend credit to innovative small businesses. Once properly up and running, companies – both small and large – need more significant tax credits for research and development. In the UK, these should be increased by as much as a third to 200%. Such a move could have a huge impact on a company’s investment decisions and would send a clear signal to business leaders about the government’s belief in science and technology. And what do I know, apart from making vacuum cleaners? Well, Dyson’s about a bit more than that these days. We make all sorts of new technology – fans, digital motors and more in the pipeline. That’s the point about R&D: we’re constantly looking at new inventions for the long term. When it comes to major UK companies filing patents, only Rolls-Royce is ahead of us. We also know a bit about selling overseas: eight out of ten of our machines are exported. They reach 49 countries, with the US being our biggest market. There’s no doubt that production in Malaysia has helped us to expand faster – we employ more than 1,200 people in the UK, 300 in the US and 2,500 globally. Dyson was built from scratch over 30 years. Parts of that time were slow and painful, but I know that the pace was quickened by employing graduates with the right skills and investing in R&D. We need to make it much easier for other businesses to do the same.

Cramer said.Following is Cramer's analysis: DSW   For DSW shareholders, the crime occurred at the end of May when  the shoe seller reported a disappointing quarter and shares fell  from $32 down to $23 in a single session.    ""Pretty much everybody bailed on DSW after that, Cramer  said. But last month I told you DSW was merely the victim of  transient fashion issues and bad weather and that a comeback was  on the way.  Sure enough, when   last night, it blew away the numbers, beating Wall Street's sales  and earnings forecasts and raising its full-year  guidance."" In turn, shares march sharply higher, gaining about 10  percent in a single session. ""No autopsy needed here."" added  Cramer with a sly smile, ""except for those poor short sellers who are now in a  world of hurt."" Sears  Going into the quarter, Cramer said Sears didn't have much of a  pulse. ""Then, the final blow was delivered last Thursday when the  company reported a larger than expected loss and missed the  estimates across the board, sending the stock down 7 percent in  one day.""  Looking at the metrics, there appear to be few signs of health.  ""This was the company's sixth consecutive , and  they lost twice as much money as they did a year ago. And  Sears is not just earnings challenged, it's sales challenged,  too; its revenues were down 10 percent year over year."" To make matters all the more concerning, the company reported a cash balance of $824  million. ""That may seem like a big improvement from the $671  million it had a year earlier, however, Sears spun-off its Lands'  End business earlier this year, giving them a one-time windfall  of $515 million.  And Sears can only do that once.   Back out that money, and the company would only have $314  million of cash, which is a pretty bleak."" All told, Sears has seen healthier days.   ""Put it all together, and you've got a retailer that just has too  many problems. The stock is still a 'sell' even down here at just  a couple points above its 52-week low,"" Cramer said Lands' End  Once a feared goner, Cramer says Lands' End may be the  proverbial victim who escaped the clutches of its captor. Well,  that may be a little dramatic, but Cramer did say Lands' End  looks much better now that it's wriggled free from Sears, which  used to own the company.  ""For years, Lands' End was stuck inside the Sears empire, passing  along its profits and unable to control its own destiny.   Now that it's been spun off as an independent company, I  think it has a bright future. In its first quarter out of the  gate, Lands' End delivered some excellent numbers, including a 48  percent jump in earnings per share.  Lands' End now has the  freedom and the resources to pursue faster growth, and its stock  is cheap, trading at 15 times next year's earnings estimates.   In the end, I think it's a survivor, one that's worth  buying here."" Abercrombie & Fitch  Cramer sees Abercrombie & Fitch as akin to the near-death  character rising from the grave (and probably scantily clad  too!)    ""Inventory levels are starting to stabilize and Abercrombie,  along with rivals, are closing stores which reduces supply,"" Cramer said. That bodes  well. ""While Abercrombie just made a new 52-week high on Tuesday,  it's still more than 30 points off its post great recession peak  in 2011, and I think it could have a lot more  upside.""  --------------------------------------------------------------  Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer 5 stocks give Cramer indigestion CEO: Stock decline buying opportunity Pharma firm with room to  run--------------------------------------------------------------  Ann Taylor  Ann Taylor may be like the victim who was rescued at the last  minute, by two watchful strangers.

""Ann has historically been a pretty strong operator, and if  the company doesn't want to sell itself, it has plenty of other  options.  For example, Ann has a pristine balance sheet, so  it could easily borrow a ton of money at very low rates in order  to finance a gigantic buyback.

""I'm not a doctor and I don't speculate about his medical details,"" he said. ""It would be disrespectful if we went into details ... Considering the difficulty of the decision I think we have to respect that.""Burgmans did explain that it was more of a preemptive decision that Buechner had taken very recently. Buechner felt that if he continued his work and subject himself to the pressure that the job entails then it could have had a detrimental effect on his health, according to the chairman.The outgoing chief earlier this year repelled a takeover attempt from U.S. rival PPG Industries. In September 2012, Buechner stepped down briefly from his role after what was described as ""over-tiredness"", according to Reuters.",12:16.3
404,Romney Comment on Olympics Riles Britain ,2012-07-26T17:14:23+0000,,Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney caused a stir in Britain on Thursday by questioning whether the country is prepared to host the Olympic Games without a hitch and scheduling a fundraiser with the former head of a troubled bank.,"cnbc, Articles, Election 2012, source:tagname:The Associated Press","Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney caused a stir in Britain on Thursday by questioning whether the country is prepared to host the Olympic Games without a hitch and scheduling a fundraiser with the former head of a troubled bank. The former Massachusetts governor visited with British political leaders as part of a larger effort to show he has what it takes to represent the U.S. on the world stage. But instead of highlighting ties with the America's staunchest ally, Romney may have embarrassed the Brits instead.British Prime Minister David Cameron offered a blunt retort to Romney and other doubters, saying they will ""see beyond doubt that Britain can deliver."" The stir came on the first full day of Romney's first international tour as the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee. With the U.S. still fighting one war and facing foreign policy challenges across the globe, Romney is seeking to convince American voters that he's prepared to serve as commander and chief, despite limited foreign policy experience. He is visiting three allies, including Israel and Poland, on the trip, appearing Friday at the Olympic opening ceremonies to help remind voters of his personal Olympic experience. Romney led the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, and used the games to launch his political career. But his foreign trip got off to a shaky start.  openly doubted whether Britain could handle the games, saying it was unclear whether issues that have dogged the final preparations could be overcome. ""It's hard to know just how well it will turn out,"" Romney told NBC News in an interview on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremonies. He later met with Cameron and they discussed the Olympics as well as Afghanistan and Syria, among other countries. Romney declined to answer questions on whether the West should do more to intervene in Syria, suggesting that he didn't ""want to describe foreign policy positions I may have while I'm on foreign soil."" Earlier Thursday, Romney and Cameron seemed to address each other through the media after Romney doubted Britain's preparedness for the Olympics. Romney suggested it's impossible for any Olympic Games to go off without a hitch; Cameron said Romney and others would soon see that England is up to the challenge. Romney backed off his initial comment after meeting with Cameron. ""I expect the games to be highly successful,"" Romney declared after the meeting. At the same time, Romney faced scrutiny for a London fundraiser Thursday night that's expected to attract employees of Barclays, which has been in the spotlight after becoming the first bank to admit its employees were involved in manipulating a key interest rate. Last month, U.S. and British agencies fined Barclays a total of $453 million. In the wake of that shock, chief executive . Diamond had been scheduled to attend the fundraiser at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in the tony Knightsbridge district, but has pulled out. He already had sent Romney a check for $2,500. Romney sought to steer the conversation away from the controversies. ""The world is a tumultuous and dangerous place,"" Romney said Thursday. ""And certainly in many of the regions around the world we have great interests in having a common effort in seeing greater peace and prosperity."" As he met with British leaders past and present, the Republican also praised ""the unique relationship that exists between our nations, our commitment to common values, our commitment to peace in the world and a desire to see a stronger and growing economy."" Romney, whose decades in private business gave him ample exposure to international affairs, is a former one-term governor untested on the world's political stage. He hopes to convince voters back home that he is no novice on foreign affairs and that they should feel confident electing him as president in a complex world and with the U.S. facing a myriad of security threats. During the public portion of his meeting with Cameron, Romney weighed in again after his comment about the Olympics drew attention across Britain. ""It is impossible for absolutely no mistakes to occur,"" he said. ""Of course there will be errors from time to time, but those are all overshadowed by the extraordinary demonstrations of courage, character and determination by the athletes."" Meeting with British officials is typically one of the first priorities of any new president, and establishing those relationships beforehand can help smooth any transition. It's not unusual for American presidential candidates to meet with British leaders during the campaign; President Barack  did so when he took a trip abroad as the likely Democratic nominee in 2008. Romney's weeklong trip also will take him to Israel and Poland. On Thursday, Romney also met with former Prime Minister Tony Blair; Ed Miliband, the current leader of the Labour Party — the opposition to Cameron's Conservative Party; and Foreign Secretary William Hague. The candidate also met with Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, Britain's top financial official. On Friday, Romney is scheduled to attend the opening ceremonies of the London Games. This wasn't Romney's first meeting with Cameron; the two talked when Romney visited London in 2011. Cameron visited the U.S. earlier this year to meet with Obama and attended a White House state dinner, but he did not meet with Romney. The meetings come a day after the Daily Telegraph published a story quoting an unidentified Romney campaign adviser saying the Republican believes the U.S. relationship with Britain is special because of shared ""Anglo-Saxon heritage"" that the adviser said the White House doesn't appreciate. Romney, however, quickly distanced himself from any such view. ""I don't agree with whoever that adviser might be,"" Romney told NBC News, ""but do agree that we have a very common bond between ourselves and Great Britain."" Nonetheless, Vice President Joe Biden and top Obama aides criticized Romney. ""The comments reported this morning are a disturbing start to a trip designed to demonstrate Gov. Romney's readiness to represent the United States on the world's stage,"" Biden said. Accompanying Romney to some of his meetings Thursday were former Missouri Sen. Jim Talent, an adviser, and Kerry Healey, who served as lieutenant governor when Romney was governor of Massachusetts. Three of Romney's sons — Tagg, Josh and Craig — also have joined him in London.",12:16.4

""He's the perfect person to lead Mixpanel into the future.""Mixpanel isn't confronting the kind of high-profile challenges Costolo faced at Twitter, which ranged from an abundance of bots and online bullying to slowing user growth and mounting losses. But the company has had its own set of hurdles.In 2014, when venture capitalists were throwing cash at anything with momentum, Mixpanel raised a big financing round from Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of over $800 million. At the time, Mixpanel was primarily serving small and medium-sized businesses and other Y Combinator grads with analytics software that helped them understand their customers' behavior so they could get them to stick around for longer periods of time.But Mixpanel realized what so many business software start-ups eventually discover: The big money is in the enterprise. So in 2016, the company cut 19 jobs, or close to 10 percent of its workforce, almost exclusively in sales, and started to refocus on selling to bigger clients.The company has also dealt with incidents of data leaks. Most recently, TechCrunch reported in February that some people using sites monitored by Mixpanel had their passwords ""mistakenly pulled into its software.""Movafaghi said Mixpanel is ""in the ZIP code"" of $100 million in annual revenue after beating its internal fourth-quarter target by 54 percent. Close to half of its revenue now comes from companies with more than 1,000 employees, including BMW, Intuit, Samsung and Uber. Still, it's competing in a fragmented market against big companies like Google and Adobe as well as a host of start-ups.Of the $77 million Mixpanel has raised in venture funding, $60 million is still in the bank, Movafaghi said. Additional private capital is a possibility but Movafaghi said he's in no rush to raise money just because it's readily available.""One of the lessons learned over the last few years is companies were overcapitalized,"" he said. ""That has come back to really hurt a lot of businesses in the Valley.""Among Movafaghi's upcoming tasks is finding a CFO to replace him. Doshi, meanwhile, plans to take some time off and then return to Mixpanel in the role of executive director, which could include working on products and helping with recruiting.

409,These candidates are out of touch,2015-12-29T12:57:26-0500,,"As 2015 comes to a close, eight debates have given us an opportunity to learn where the top-tier candidates on both sides of the aisle stand on the economic issues that matter most to working families — child care, minimum wage, equal pay and paid family leave. We got useful insights into which candidates support working families — and which ones are ignoring them.  Child care, one of the biggest issues facing Americans today, has received almost no attention. The first five years of a child's life are critical for learning social and emotional skills, as well as for setting them up to be good students and citizens later in life. Once children start school, they often need to attend after-school programs while their parents work. Wondering how to afford safe educational environments for our kids keeps parents up at night.     According to our recent polling, affordable child care is one of the key issues voters say would sway them to vote for a candidate. Yet, it has only come up three times during the debates — once when Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mentioned her support for early childhood education in an answer (before being cut off by the moderator), once when Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  talked about how his wife, as first lady, could help him address the dysfunctional child care system in the U.S., and once when Florida Senator Marco Rubio was asked about his child tax credit plan. Rubio said that in many states child care costs more than college, and families don't know how they will make their payments every month, let alone save for college. Yet his $2,500 child tax plan is a drop in the bucket compared to the more than $12,000 a year families pay for care for their four-year olds in some states. And it does nothing to support the people who care for our little ones, who are paid, on average, $10.30 an hour. Even Rubio has acknowledged that $10 an hour is not enough to live on.    Child care should be a huge issue for the presidential candidates.  Another issue that would impact the economic security of women and families (and their votes) is the minimum wage. One of the clearest distinctions to come out of the presidential debates has been the Democratic candidates' support for, and the Republican  candidates' opposition to, raising the federal minimum wage. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Raising it would disproportionately benefit women, who are two-thirds of the country's minimum wage earners, and would help millions of families make ends meet.  Sanders and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley support an increase to $15 per hour and Clinton supports an increase to $12 per hour nationally, as well as $15 per hour in certain areas. Meanwhile, the debates revealed that Donald Trump, Ben Carson  and Rubio are strongly opposed to a minimum wage increase. With women currently paid on average 79 cents for every dollar paid to men, a minimum wage increase is a big deal not just for helping families stay afloat, but also for getting closer to equal pay for women and men.   Consistent with their support for an increase in the federal minimum wage, Sanders and Clinton have been proactive about their support for equal pay for equal work, and Clinton has specifically called for pay transparency and the Paycheck Fairness Act. These policies help address the fact that if women don't know they are being paid differently, it's impossible to fix the problem. Yet, on the GOP side, Texas Senator Ted Ted Cruz and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina avoided answering a question about the problem of unequal pay, pivoting instead to a conversation about single moms and rising poverty among women (yet without saying what they would do about it).    On paid family and medical leave, all three Democratic candidates used the debates to express their strong support for it, noting that the United States is one of the only nations in the world without it. In states that have adopted a paid family and medical leave policy, employers and employees alike report benefiting from it. Yet, the Republican debates have been silent on the issue.     In fact, the Republican debates have largely ignored all of the issues that would truly support working families — and only revealed how out of touch the candidates are with the realities of today's workforce. As just one example, take the final Republican debate of the year, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, ostensibly one of the most moderate candidates of the batch, talked about about moms dropping off kids at the bus stop while dads went to work. As we end 2015, moms are actually breadwinners in two-thirds of families in the United States. Candidates with outdated views like Christie's share a lack of vision for updating our workplace rules to match today's realities.      In 2016, candidates have the opportunity to get even more specific about what they will do to make sure no one has to choose between being there for family and earning a living. Instead of using hate and fear-based rhetoric that stokes anxiety and unrest, candidates should focus on how they will improve the quality of life for the millions of working families in the U.S. The best way to do this: share their visions for national economic solutions that will help us all, together, make it work.

On Google wearables, Cassidy says Ambarella won a contract to be  part of Google's ""Helpouts"" services, which include a customer  service person helping with fixing your car, or taking Yoga or  Piano lessons through a small video camera linked to a Wi-Fi or  Bluetooth network. Read MoreCramer: GoPro stock is in a ""sweet  spot""  The main driver for Ambarella's business, however, is the  security and surveillance market, said Wang. Clients such as FLIR  Systems and leading surveillance equipment suppliers like  Hikvision rely on Ambarella's technology.IP security cameras constitute 45 percent of its business,  and that segment—which is growing 25 percent year-over-year—is ""a  bigger growth engine than GoPro,"" Cassidy said. Axis Communications of Sweden  is its biggest customer, and it has some smaller clients in China,  he said. Dashboard cameras are for now a small part of its  business, but growing popularity in China and Eastern  Europe and the possibility that more auto manufacturers could begin installing them points to another potential big growth engine for the company, Cassidy said.Wang also believes there is opportunity in the growing market for drones, as  manufacturers increasingly look to equip these unmanned aerial  vehicles with miniature HD-quality cameras.Not everyone sees a completely rosy growth forecast for the company, though. After the stock's strong run, analysts at  Deutsche Bank now argue that much of the good news in this story  is already priced in. Plus, the entire semiconductor market has been on a tear lately, and some analysts believe that run is about over.Read MoreWhy semiconductor stocks may be ready for a fall  Also, the company specializes in a very competitive market, where  it has to go head-to-head with rivals such as Texas Instruments  and Xilinx. But other analysts such as Suji De Silva of Topeka Capital  Markets say Ambarella has competitive advantages, for example chips that are more power efficient than competitors.  Bulls on the stock are also fans of Ambarella's management team.  Wang boasts a strong background in semiconductor design, and he  has already founded and sold one company called Afara  Websystems.   So is Ambarella an acquisition target? Cassidy thinks that tech  giants or other chip companies could be interested in buying the  company.  Cassidy says that the Wang and his partner have sold two other  companies and he sees Ambarella as a ""possible acquisition  candidate.""  ""Qualcomm, Nvidia or Intel are possible candidates, and I wouldn't  rule out Google or Facebook,  either,"" he said  A representative for Ambarella did not  respond to requests for comment on whether they'd be willing to  be acquired.—By CNBC's Mark Berniker and Josh Lipton.

Kennedy was shot in  Dallas.  Like virtually every American who was around then, he remembers where he was when he got the news.  More than that, though, he recalls the market impact  before anyone even knew what was going on. Wall Street  was in sell mode before it became clear what had happened that  fateful day, according to a remembrance Cashin shared with  clients Friday morning.  Cashin, now director of floor operations at UBS, had started at  Thomas McKinnon—now part of Prudential—in 1959. The  1963 assassination happened a year before he would go on to become  a member of the New York Stock Exchange and a partner at P.R.  Herzig.     On the floor of the NYSE selling had begun before any headlines    hit the tape. Months later I learned that was thanks to a    savvy branch manager in Dallas.  The manager of whom Cashin spoke figured it would be a slow day  in the city due to the Kennedy motorcade that was expected to  pass through. Consequently, he decided to let most of this  staff go watch the parade, keeping only a skeleton crew around  the office.  But when the crew returned after hearing the event was  canceled—without knowing why—the manager grew  concerned, according to Cashin's knowledge of the story:     After questioning, he learned that they had heard the sirens    accelerate, the police lights flare and the ""parade"" suddenly    turn right.  They were many blocks away and obviously    heard no shots.       The savvy manager quickly asked—""Give me a bullish reason    to pull a president out of a parade?"" ""It's not to sign a tax    bill—that could wait."" No one could think of a bullish    reason to divert a parade. Then they mulled bearish reasons. No one thought assassination. But they did think natural    disaster, nuclear accident, missile threat and scores of    others. That's when they decided something ""bad"" must have    happened and began to sell.       As their sell orders poured onto the floor and prices began to    melt, they were asked by brokers—""Why the selling?"" The    response was the incomplete—""something about the    President.""    The horror of what had actually happened soon hit.     Sometime later, the first headline hit—""Shots reported    fired at President's motorcade!"" The selling broadened and accelerated. Rather quickly the next headline—""President    reported hit.""       Exchange leaders hastily gathered and discussed closing the exchange. Then the headline ""Motorcade diverted to Parkland    Hospital."" They rang the bell at 2:07 (EST).       The Dow fell the equivalent of what would be 460 points today.    When we reopened Tuesday, there was such a sigh of relief that    power had been transferred and the Constitution still    functioned, that a massive rally erupted, soaring the    equivalent of 710 points.

The press release quotes a doctor in The Netherlands who says that shows how important it is for people who want to quit to seek out a professional. Of course, that's how potential quitters can get a prescription for the relatively new drug PFE makes to stop smoking. It's sold as Chantix in the U.S. and Champix overseas. The world's biggest drugmaker is pushing the drug in an ubiquitous ad campaign featuring the tortoise and the hare. In fact, as I'm writing this blog entry I'm watching the spot during a break on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" at 10:15 a.m. ET.And I've seen new internet ads saying, ""Resolve to quit in 2008."" Pfizer's apparently turning up the volume because Chantix is one of the few bright spots in its product portfolio these days. Lipitor sales are falling and it recently gave up on another once-promising new product--the inhalable insulin, Exubera.PFE sold nearly a quarter-billion dollars worth of Chantix in the third quarter. But it will be interesting to see the fourth quarter numbers after the FDA and its UK equivalent recently told doctors to be on the lookout for abnormal behavior among their Chantix patients. Australia has already gone so far as to put a warning on the drug about the possibility of feeling depressed, agitated or thinking about suicide while taking Champix. Eventually, some say the same thing will happen here. A couple of other noteworthy findings of the Pfizer survey: 45 percent said concerns about health problems were a major factor in their decision to quit and 28 percent said the cost of smokes influenced them. Not a coincidence, I'm guessing, that another new ad appears on ""The New York Times"" web site homepage today that says, ""Calculate how much your smoking habit costs.""  The survey participants hadn't taken a puff for at least a year. Interestingly, yesterday when the Dow and the American pharma sector tanked, PFE shares were up a fraction. Maybe it was a dog of the Dow thing on the first trading day of the year--Pfizer was one of the index's worst performers in 2007. It started this year not much off of its low of 22 bucks and change, so it could be investor bargain hunting and/or the still-attractive dividend. Pfizer's obviously hoping Chantix sales will help ""light up"" the stock this year. Questions?  Comments?  Pharma@cnbc.com",12:17.5

424,How to nail a pitch to a &lsquo;Shark&rsquo;,2016-03-04T12:09:11-0500,,"Being an angel investor is pretty amazing. You're constantly learning about new businesses and meeting driven entrepreneurs willing to risk everything to follow their dreams. You're pulling for them, and you hope to be part of their journey in reaching success. That's why it's also heartbreaking when you see an entrepreneur make a misstep because you know how much is at stake!     If you can believe it, I've seen entrepreneurs pitch and never once mention their own backgrounds ... when they are the most important driver of the business!  I've also seen entrepreneurs finish pitching, leave the room, and then hear my angel investor colleagues say out loud that they still don't know what the company does.  These are avoidable scenarios. Whether you're pitching to individual angel investors or a tank of ""Sharks"" on TV, here are some DO's and DON'Ts entrepreneurs should keep in mind during their pitch to increase their chances of success.   1. Explain your business model and exactly how you make money. This includes addressing pricing, costs, and margins. Your investors need to understand the economics of solving this problem or serving a need.  2. Explain why YOU are the best team to make this happen. Investors want to know your background and areas of expertise. We need to understand why we would bet on you vs. any other players in the space. 3. Address your competitive edge. That can include intellectual property, patent protection, and exclusive relationships. We need to understand what prevents others from replicating what you're doing. 4. Talk about your long-term vision for the company. This includes growth plans for future products and geographic markets. If you're raising money, we also need to know the terms and your ""exit strategy"" for return on capital. 5. Explain how your business scales. We want to know that this is more than just a niche opportunity. Describe how you would grow across a large customer base in various geographies while making the most of limited resources. And explain what your sales and marketing plan is for acquiring customers.   1. Launch into a long story before you say what you do. So don't start by talking about the customer's problem, the market, or your team. If you don't tell us what you do first, you've already lost our attention. 2. Forget to address any relevant legal issues and risks. We would never want to be blindsided by a government action or customer lawsuit. Help us understand the potential risks and how you're addressing them. 3. Stretch the truth! Be honest and authentic. Support your claims with facts, research, and data, and independently measure your results. If something sounds too good to be true to us, we know it probably is! 4. Forget to address seasonality or cyclicality of your product or industry. We need to understandthe volatility of sales and customer behavior so that we aren't surprised byunexpected changes in results.  5. Forget to show passion and deliver a great presentation! It's all about the entrepreneur after all, and we want to believe in you! Ideas are a dime a dozen, but a dynamic entrepreneur who knows how to execute is pure gold!

The document was penned by California Rep.

Trump has read the memo, NBC News reported, citing several White House officials.The White House doesn't plan to directly release the memo, according to spokesman Raj Shah: ""That's not the plan right now.""

Once Trump decides whether to release the memo, the White House counsel's office will let the House Intelligence Committee know.The panel had voted along party lines to approve the release of the memo, which Nunes put together. The memo, which has been hyped by Trump supporters and partisan pundits, is said to focus on the FBI's alleged use of a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, who was paid by Democrats for his investigation of Trump's interactions with Russians.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday demanded that House Speaker Paul Ryan remove Nunes as chairman of the intelligence panel, saying he has ""disgraced"" the panel.The ranking Democratic member of the committee, Adam Schiff of California, released a statement late Wednesday that said Nunes altered the memo after the committee's vote to release it to the White House.Schiff also wrote a memo to rival the Republicans' document, but the House intelligence panel voted against releasing the Democrat's document.",12:19.8

If you could order a  self-driving taxi at the tap of a button, why would car ownership  be necessary?   But two major auto giants aren't worried and said that while Uber  will enjoy great success, the connected car will become a  consumer device that people will want to own.

As well as the connected experience of cars, the use cases will continue to differ in the future. While Uber  might be useful for ""megacities"" in which parking and congestion  is a problem, other areas will still see car ownership continue,  according to one Volvo Cars executive.

But not all share Musk's very short timeline. Ghosn said that  while Renault is testing autonomous vehicles in Palo Alto,  California, regulation and reliability of the cars could stop  them getting into consumers' hands any time soon.  ""I'm a little bit skeptical when a carmaker…says we are  going to be able to sell cars, autonomously driven, before 2020,  in 2018, when the regulation is not ready.

With the Chinese putting the brakes on their economy and the lack of domestic orders here in the US, ""the steel business seems to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, even as steel prices rise around the world,"" Cramer said.NUE reported a better than expected fourth quarter yesterday, but compared to a year ago things look rather dreary. The company’s average sales price per ton is down 35% year over year, total tons shipped to outside customers down 9% year over year and steel mill capacity utilization was at a historically low 54%.Cramer has liked Nucor for its 3.4% dividend yield and last recommended it on December 23 at $46. The stock is down 8% since then, but investors have made a considerable amount of money over the long-term, returning 241% to shareholders over the past ten years or 297% if you reinvested the dividend. And within the same period, the S&P 500 was down 24%. This is looking like a difficult time in the steel industry. DiMicco himself has said that the recovery will be long and slow, especially with the employment picture so bleak and the Obama administration not doing enough to create jobs here in America. Cramer said this is something that’s become even more important now that the Chinese are slowing down their overheated economy. So, is there a future for the steel industry? And why are earnings anemic despite all of the price increases? And can Dan DiMicco, who met with the President multiple times on these issues, give any behind the scenes input?

Nearly 23 percent of home purchases in December were by investors, according to a new survey from Campbell/Inside Mortgage Finance. That is a slight increase from November, but the share has remained largely unchanged for the past year. What has changed dramatically is how many of these investors are using all-cash…74 percent according to the survey, which also found that, “cash buyers are able to bid significantly lower—and successfully—on many properties because they offer a shorter and more reliable closing timeline.” That is precisely what mortgage servicers want. “While investor bids may not be the first offers accepted, they often end up winning properties after other homebuyers are eliminated because of mortgage approval or timeline problems,” according to the survey authors. “Appraisals below the contracted price are a common reason for mortgage denials. Most mortgage financing timelines are now in excess of 30 days.” There has been a lot of concern among industry analysts that bulk foreclosure sales would push home prices down further, but it appears that is already happening, as investors usually offer 10-20 percent below list price, while first time home buyers and current homeowners are generally offering list.

If you look at the Lipper (AMG) equity fund flow numbers so far this year, it looks fairly positive: The four-week average for weekly equity flows shows inflows of anywhere from $600 million to $4.5 billion...healthy! But look below the hood: If you remove exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , there are still inflows, but they are much more modest....anywhere from $200 million to $800 million.

The global investment bank is highest on Noble Energy , whose shares may rise 50 percent in the next six months, according to its forecast. Goldman Sachs says Brent crude oil should rise to about $130 a barrel within a year from $114 today, driven by demand in emerging economies.","cnbc, Articles, Exxon Mobil Corp, Noble Energy Inc, Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, CVR Energy Inc, Disclaimer, Bonds, Currencies, Futures & Commodities, DOW 30, Markets, stocks, Stock Blog, source:tagname:The Street","Goldman Sachs, which advised investors to sell oil in April and reversed its stance before prices rebounded a month later, is now the most bullish on four stocks in the industry. The global investment bank is highest on Noble Energy , whose shares may rise 50 percent in the next six months, according to its forecast. Goldman Sachs says Brent crude oil should rise to about $130 a barrel within a year from $114 today, driven by demand in emerging economies. A slowdown in economic growth has had analysts scrambling to alter their forecasts. Even the Federal Reserve has said the U.S. economy is growing more slowly than it had expected earlier in the year. The International Energy Agency last week reduced its oil demand estimate by 0.2 million barrels a day for 2011 and 0.4 million barrels a day for 2012. However, the agency still forecasts oil demand to be marginally higher than the current supply next year.Analysts are bullish on select stocks as industry consolidation is ongoing, and because high growth rates in emerging markets provide a floor for share prices and oil stocks can serve as an inflation hedge. Some companies are paying outsized dividends, which are attractive as Treasury yields have fallen to less than 2 percent. For example, Exxon Mobil carries a hefty 2.6 percent projected dividend yield, in addition to an estimated 35 percent stock-appreciation forecast over the next six months. Oil and gas exploration and production companies' shares are down an average of 13 percent this year, according to Morningstar. That's three times as much as that of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. So anyone moving into oil stocks now must reconcile the fact that the industry has been a laggard. Here are Goldman Sachs' current ""conviction list"" energy-stock picks: 1. Noble Energy is a Houston-based oil and gas producer in the U.S., with diverse developable resources including in Equatorial Guinea, the North Sea, Israel and China. It has extensive offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico. About 30 percent of its natural gas production is in the U.S., including oil shale projects. Goldman analysts said in a recent research note that Noble ""has a strong balance sheet, with a 16 percent net debt to tangible capital ratio even before substantial expected free cash flow in the next three years, as long lead time projects come online."" Noble gets a six-month $121 price target from Goldman, which is a 50 percent premium to its current price. Its shares have a projected 1 percent dividend yield. The company's shares are down 5 percent this year, but up 6 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a market valuation of $14 billion. 2. Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest companies, is an integrated oil and gas producer and distributor and also the world's biggest refiner. It is also one of the world's top manufacturers of commodity and specialty chemicals. Due to its operational efficiencies, it consistently delivers higher returns on capital relative to peers and its sheer size gives it leverage in the competition for developable oil projects worldwide. Its current production mix is evenly split between liquids and natural gas. In its latest blockbuster deal, the company announced Sept. 2 that it had entered an agreement with the Russian-government owned oil company Rosneft, to jointly explore and develop oil and gas resources in Russia, the U.S., and other countries. Its strong, steady cash flow assures increasing dividend payments and stock buy backs, even while funding huge capital-intensive projects. Goldman has a six-month $97 price target on its shares, a 33 percent premium to its current price. Its shares are up 1 percent this year and 22 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a $356 billion market valuation. 3. CVR Energy is a nitrogen-fertilizer and petroleum-refining company. It also runs a crude-oil gathering system and storage facility in Kansas and a proprietary pipeline system that transports crude oil to its refinery. Goldman has a six-month $32 price target on its shares, a 23 percent premium to the current price. Its shares are up 65 percent this year and 207 percent over the past 12 months, giving it a $2.2 billion market value. 4. Hornbeck Offshore: The only repeat on the conviction list of three months ago is Hornbeck Offshore, a provider of offshore supply vessel fleets, which it uses to transport goods and supplies to and from offshore rigs and platforms, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. It also has a large fleet of tug and tank barges, which mostly transport petroleum. Goldman analysts say the company remains on their list based on the belief ""that the recovery in the Gulf of Mexico is under way."" They write that ""earnings should accelerate sharply over the next few quarters as additional (offshore vessels) go to work. We expect Hornbeck to return to profitability as soon as the fourth quarter."" It posted a loss of 26 cents per share in the second quarter. The firm has a $31 price target on its shares over the next six months, a 12 percent premium to its current price. Its shares have a market value of $751 million. They've been rocketing, gaining 14 percent in the past month, 36 percent this year and 79 percent over the past 12 months. ______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks—In Real Time Oil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices Now Where's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer",12:21.5

448,More US Service Jobs Heading Offshore,2012-12-07T17:17:03+0000,,"The strike that crippled two of the nation's busiest shipping  ports was settled this week, but the trend it spotlighted —  the offshoring of service jobs — is expected to continue to  grow across the USA.  The eight-day walkout by clerical workers at the ports of Los  Angeles and Long Beach largely centered on the outsourcing of  their jobs overseas and to elsewhere in the U.S., says Craig  Merrilees, a spokesman for the International Longshore and  Warehouse Union. Shippers denied outsourcing jobs, but the  tentative settlement restricts the practice, according to the  Associated Press.Service companies have been sending jobs abroad in large  numbers the past decade to cut labor costs — a trend that  accelerated in the recession and is expected to continue the next  few years before slowing after 2016. About 663,000 large-company  jobs in information technology, human resources, finance and  purchasing — the category that includes the port workers  — have been offshored since 2002, according to The Hackett  Group.  By 2016, the consulting firm estimates, another 375,000 jobs in  the sectors will be moved abroad. More than a third of the U.S.  jobs in those industries in 2002 will have moved offshore by  2016.  Most workers are employed directly by companies that previously  used U.S. staffers, though some work for outsourcing firms.  Hackett studied companies with at least $1 billion in annual  revenue, noting they represent about 75% of the offshoring  market.  India is the largest offshoring center. Service jobs also have  gone to eastern Europe, the Philippines, China and Mexico.(Read More: How Immigrants Are Changing U.S. Businesses)  In other sectors, initially low-level jobs were offshored, such  as handling payroll or tracking purchase orders. Employers  typically can cut labor costs by about 75 percent, Dorr says. In recent  years, a growing number of higher-level jobs have moved overseas,  such as benefits analysis and vendor management, though the cost  savings for offshoring those positions is only about 25 percent.The  trend took off after companies began contracting with programmers  in India to help with the massive preparations for the Y2K  computer bug in 2000, says Hackett research director Erik Dorr.

Since 2005, legal services such as document review, contract  drafting and regulatory communication increasingly have been  offshored, particularly to India, says Greg McPolin, managing  director of Pangea3, a legal outsourcing firm. Indian attorneys  handle work that in the U.S. is sometimes done by paralegals and  at a 40 to 60 percent cost savings, he says.

""In the current environment, it is more important than ever that  … the support we provide to clients adds value without  adding unnecessary cost,"" law firm Clifford Chance said in a  statement.  Once services are offshored, there's little chance they'll come  back to the U.S., Dorr says. By contrast, manufacturers have  returned some production to the U.S. recently, largely because of  a narrowing wage gap between the U.S. and China, rising shipping  costs and falling U.S. energy costs — factors that generally  haven't affected service jobs.  One exception: call-centers. About 500,000 of these jobs were offshored  from 2006 to 2010, according to the Communications Workers of  America.

451,COMMODITIES-Down after post-storm oil supply boost; cocoa jumps,2012-11-03T01:13:00+0000,,"* Foreign oil tankers help ease supply crunch in US Northeast* Little focus on better-than-expected US jobs data for Oct* Oil prices lose 2 pct on the day; Brent down 4 pct* Gold hits 2-month low; copper ends down for 4th week* Cocoa rallies on Ghana supply squeeze, bucking weak trendNEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled on Friday as foreign tankers were allowed to bring fuel from U.S. ports to the Northeast to ease a supply crunch after Hurricane Sandy, and metals and other key commodities fell on worries the devastation from the storm could hamper the economic recovery. The declines wiped out Thursday's gains that came after markets appeared to gain a sense of normalcy following the massive storm earlier this week that killed at least 102 people. Many in the stricken region were still without power, gasoline and information about when their shattered lives might return to normal. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on the day, with U.S. crude settling below $85 a barrel and London's Brent finishing under $106. Brent, which affects global oil prices more than U.S. crude, fell nearly 4 percent on the week. Gasoline futures in New York also fell more than 2 percent, to below $2.58 per gallon, as oil tankers and pipelines supplying New Jersey and the New York Harbor - the delivery point for the U.S. contract - restored more operations that had been roiled by the hurricane. The Thomson Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a bellwether for commodities, fell 1.6 percent after 14 of its 19 components settled in negative territory. The selloff came despite a stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report for October which ordinarily would have sent prices rallying. While oil and gasoline fell over 2 percent, natural gas was the CRB's biggest loser for the day. It tumbled 4 percent on milder weather forecasts for the U.S. Northeast next week that reduced the potential demand for gas as a heating fuel. Oil came under pressure after the U.S. government temporarily waived Jones Act restrictions on tankers carrying fuel from the Gulf Coast refining hub to the hard-hit Northeast, increasing the fleet of ships that would normally be confined to domestic vessels and crews. ``I think economic uncertainty and next week's (U.S.) elections are weighing on oil prices. You also have the statement that the Jones Act is going to be waived for a week, suggesting some supplies are going to return,'' said analyst Gene McGillian at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.GOLD AT 2-MONTH LOW, COPPER DOWN U.S. gold futures hit a two-month low below $1,700 an ounce and were down almost 2 percent this week, settling at below $1,682 to mark a fourth consecutive weekly decline. Gold has erased all its gains made after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its latest bond buybacks to boost the job market in September. ``Better-than-expected numbers reduced the risk demand for gold, and a drop below $1,700 an ounce triggered sell-stops and momentum selling,'' said James Steel, metals analyst at HSBC. ``There are also long liquidation ahead of elections triggered by the job number,'' Steel said. Copper prices fell for a fourth consecutive week. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $7,665.50 a tonne in official rings, down 2 percent from Thursday's close of $7,826 a tonne. Corn and soybeans fell about 2 percent each on Midwest harvest projections that suggested both crops may be larger than previously thought.COCOA BUCKS LOWER TREND Cocoa bucked the weakness in other commodities, pushing above technical support levels as some exports faced a holdup and purchases slowed in the main West African growing region. New York-traded cocoa futures closed up $27, or 1.1 percent, at $2,447 per tonne, as traders watched the early progress of main crop harvests in West Africa. The market climbed for a second straight day after hitting its 200-day moving average around $2,352. Cocoa purchases in Ghana, the world's second-biggest producer of the crop, stood at 86,028 tonnes by Oct. 19 in the first week of the season, down 42 percent from the same period a year ago, trade data showed on Thursday.

Last week, the central bank surprised markets by sharply  devaluing the yuan, which the government said was part of reforms  meant to make its exchange rate more market-oriented. Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial  Services Group, said August's flash PMI reading showed that China  was adding to global inflation doldrums.  ""At the margin, this additional evidence of China's weakening  economy puts downward pressure on global prices of oil, coal,  iron ore, steel and other basic materials. China is one more  force for weak global inflation in late 2015 and 2016,"" he  said.  Adams expects China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth may  slip below 7.0 percent in the second half of 2015. The economy  grew an annual 7.0 percent in both the first and second  quarter of this year.   Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, on  the other hand, believes downside risks to growth in the  short-run are now overstated.   ""Credit growth has begun to accelerate on the back of recent  policy easing, which should feed through into stronger activity,  albeit with a lag,"" Evans-Pritchard said.

Advertising in printed newspapers and magazines saw the steepest declines followed by outdoor billboards, radio and TV.Advertising is typically one of the first things businesses cut back on during recessions and this year's TV Upfronts in the U.S., where broadcast networks woo marketers, have been delayed indefinitely. Many of the companies surveyed in a report by consultancy Advertiser Perceptions said they could replace the reach of traditional TV ads with those in streaming services or via digital video ads.A lack of demand for media buys has also made ad spots cheaper, according to WARC data. For example, the cost of digital video ads was forecast to go up by 6.7% globally by media audit company ECI Media Management but is only likely to increase by 1.3%, per WARC. In terms of recovery, ad spend has historically shown a good relationship with economic growth, Goldman noted, with every 1% change to GDP usually translating to ad revenue growth going up two to three times.However, the post-pandemic recovery is likely to be less significant than the one after the 2008-2009 recession. The global TV ad market grew 14% in 2010 after a 7% decline in 2009 per figures from Magna Global, and Goldman expects European broadcasters to see growth of only 6% after an 18% decline this year.Broadcasters are also likely to be more open to partnerships and M&A, Goldman noted, with Italian broadcaster Mediaset set to acquire a 25% stake in Germany's ProSieben this year, for example. The report's authors also expect more partnerships in streaming services — in the U.K., ITV and the BBC launched Britbox in November.Broadcast stocks were the worst-performing sector in the European media market according to Goldman's report, down 41% on average year-to-date. This compares to a 27% decline for companies in the STOXX 600 Media, an index of European stocks.Goldman expects net annualized returns to decline between 30% and 50% for European broadcasters in the second quarter, with French channels including TF1 and M6 decreasing the most, and German broadcasters RTL and ProSieben being impacted the least.",12:23.7

465,Could China's Bird Flu Be the Next SARS?,2013-04-18T07:45:26+0000,Katie Holliday,"As the death toll from a deadly strain of bird flu in China rises  to 17, China watchers say they are closely following Beijing's  handling of the outbreak although officials appear to have  learned a trick or two from the SARS crisis a decade ago.  Eight fresh cases of the H7N9 bird flu virus have been reported  in the eastern provinces of China this week, bringing the total  figure of those infected to 82, Reuters reported. China is also  investigating the possibility of human-to-human transmission of  bird flu, a top Chinese health official was quoted as saying on  Thursday.  Some analysts are drawing parallels with the outbreak of severe  acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) between 2002 and 2003, which  damaged international trade between China and  other countries and led to the virtual shut down of Beijing, China's  capital city.  If the bird flu epidemic accelerates in a similar fashion,  investor sentiment could be severely damaged, said one analyst.  ""The obvious benchmark is SARS. That was a catastrophe and the  Chinese government learnt a lot of lessons from that,"" said Tim  Condon, head of research for Asia at ING Financial Markets.  ""At the moment the bird flu outbreak appears to be under control,  but if it turns out to be much more virulent than expected you  could see the same sort of reaction as we saw to SARS,"" he said.  The outbreak of SARS, a viral respiratory disease spread between  humans, in South China and Hong Kong between the end of 2002 and  the summer of 2003, affected around 8,000 and led to more than  700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

YUM Brands, which runs the popular KFC  brand in China, has said its March sales in its China restaurants  fell 13 percent because of bird flu worries.  (Read More: Yum's China  Sales Fall Sharply Amid Bird-Flu Scare)  Russia has started introducing medical check-ups for passengers returning  from China, according to press reports, raising worries that  China's tourism industry could be hurt by the bird-flu outbreak.  Condon said Beijing seems to be handling the outbreak differently  in comparison to the SARS crisis and that was good for investor  confidence.  ""Back in 2003, they (Chinese authorities) were hiding the real  numbers, and they even punished the doctor who revealed them. It  was a real disaster. The authorities have now learned from that,  and that means there is maybe a lower risk of a SARS level of  panic,"" he added.  Alistair Chan, an economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed that the  way China handles virus outbreaks has improved since SARS.  ""The reaction seems much more mature,"" he said. ""The government  is getting the U.S. and Australia to advise them on the issue and  there is less of a cover up going on.""  So far the impact on Chinese markets appears to be limited  although analysts say bird flu concerns could be a contributing  factor to weakness in Chinese equities markets, which have taken  a hit from news on Monday of an unexpected fall in China's  first-quarter economic growth.

Patrick Chovanec, managing director and chief strategist at  Silvercrest Asset Management, said he was carefully watching how  bird flu outbreak would impact the economy.

Brimhall prompts his own clients to envision their future with a  ""dream book.""""It's good to have that conversation about where you plan  to retire 10 to 15 years out, because it needs to be given a fair  amount of thought,"" he said. ""The earlier you plan, the better.""  Before deciding where they'd like to live, for example, Brimhall  encourages retirement planners to first determine what they hope  to gain. Read MoreSorry! You can't retire yet  ""There are a lot of different reasons why people want to  relocate, and answering the 'why' component is most important  because it determines the next questions and what homework you  need to do,"" he said.   For many, proximity to grandchildren is paramount, but that often  translates into a higher cost of living.   Others live modestly during their working years but desire a  more luxurious lifestyle after they stop punching the  clock—which requires a more aggressive savings and  investment strategy during their peak earning years.   And still others seek warmer weather or lower taxes, but many of  the most popular states with coveted zero-income-tax  status—such as Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas,  Washington and Wyoming—aren't as retiree-friendly as they  first appear.Read MoreTest your Social Security smarts  ""It's worth unwrapping that piece a little more and taking a more  granular look,"" said Neil Krishnaswamy, a certified financial  planner with Exencial Wealth Advisors. ""Some states that  don't have an income tax may make up for it with higher sales or  property taxes, so you want to look at the whole picture to  determine true cost of living.""   Remember, too, that if you live half the year or less in an  income tax–free state—like many 'snowbirds,' who flee to  warmer climes during the winter months—you may still owe tax  on retirement income earned in your home state.    Another consideration: If you plan to work even after you retire,  out of necessity or by choice, you will want to consider  employment opportunities when selecting a new locale.  The Center for a Secure  Retirement reports that 28 percent of baby boomers who  retired from their full-time career are either currently employed  or have worked during retirement.  AARP's livability index scores neighborhoods  and communities nationwide for the services and amenities that  impact seniors most, including housing costs, social outlets,  entertainment, work opportunities and access to medical  care.   Seniors who are still in  early retirement—when relocation decisions are usually  made—often fail to consider the importance of public  transportation, explains Rodney Harrell, director of Livable Communities  for the AARP Public Policy Institute.    ""A lot of people don't think about transportation, but when you  can no longer drive, you need to have community amenities  available, like alternative methods of transportation,"" to reach  retailers, grocery stores and health-care providers, he  said.   As you define your relocation goals with a financial advisor,  said Krishnaswamy at Exencial Wealth Advisors, it's equally  important to communicate with your spouse. Read MoreIt's never too early to plan retirement  Married couples may agree on a destination but differ on the size  of the home they feel they need—a one-bedroom condominium on  the beach, a single-family home with grandkid-friendly guest  rooms or a 55-plus community that will enable them to age in  place.    Such decisions not only impact the couple's quality of life but  their available cash flow, as well. And disagreement  inevitably creates tension.   Relocation at any life stage is a major stressor, said  Krishnaswamy, but the newly retired face the added pressure of  leaving their professional careers behind, spending more time at  home with their spouse and learning to live off their limited  savings.   ""Having the right expectations and conversations about what  lifestyle you both envision can help prevent arguments and  disagreements down the road,"" he added.  Krishnaswamy suggests that, before selling their home and leaving  their social network behind, retirees who intend to  relocate—especially to a city where they've only ever  vacationed—might first consider testing the waters.   Try renting for part of the year to be sure the culture, climate  and cost of living are a fit.   Indeed, the road to Florida is littered with so-called  halfbacks—retirees who realized the Sunshine State wasn't  for them and relocated a second time (and at no small expense) to  a more active senior community in Georgia or the Carolinas.   Relocation during retirement does not necessarily solve any  problems, and it can create new ones.

473,New TalentBin Interest Scores to Provide Recruiters with a Quick Measure of the Intensity of a Candidates' Professional Interests,2012-10-08T13:03:00+0000,,,"cnbc, Articles, Meta Platforms Inc, LinkedIn Corp, Information Technology, San Francisco, California, North America, United States, Press Releases, CNBC Information and Policies, CNBC: News Releases, source:tagname:PR Newswire","SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- TalentBin, the talent search engine that turbo-charges talent discovery across the web, today announced the launch of TalentBin Scores, a new addition to the company's flagship social recruiting solution, providing a relative weight for how intensely candidates exhibit a given professional interest or skill across the web. TalentBin Scores will be unveiled in Booth #955 at the 2012 HR Technology Conference and Exposition, where the company will also be showcased as one of the most innovative software solutions that promise to enhance and improve the HR function in the ""Awesome New Technologies for HR"" session presented by HR technology guru Bill Kutik. Since its launch this spring, TalentBin has quickly demonstrated its strength at filling in information gaps for recruiters and hiring managers by scouring the web for clues left by candidates on social media sites and online professional communities – delivering a more complete and well-rounded web resume. Unlike online profiles or traditional resumes that lack an expressed measure of depth in a particular professional interest, TalentBin Scores provide an indicator of intensity of a given professional interest, to better help recruiters and hiring managers quickly assess if a candidate could be the right fit – significantly streamlining the filtering process. With the addition of TalentBin Scores, the company is going deeper into the candidate profile, to not only tell prospective employers what a candidate knows, but the intensity with which they demonstrate that know how. Drawn from observable online activity, these indicator levels can not only help recruiters see the relative intensities of a candidate's various professional interests, but also help them compare the intensities of the same interests between multiple candidates. Ultimately, TalentBin Scores are designed to enable employers to more quickly and efficiently zero in on candidates most likely to fit their specific skills requirements for their open positions.""As part of the TalentBin process of interpreting online professional activity to identify the skills that would be relevant to an employer, we naturally discovered that the skills and interests we found were not all at equal strength,"" explained Peter Kazanjy, co-founder of TalentBin. ""When a recruiter is scanning LinkedIn or other professional profiles, they are lucky to get all the skills they are looking for listed – no less a scale of how deeply a candidate may be involved with a given skill or interest. TalentBin Score was created to solve that problem, providing a quick measure of the strength of those interests.""Currently, more than 100 leading companies, including Facebook, Groupon, Dolby, and Yahoo!, rely on TalentBin for their online sourcing and social recruiting needs. TalentBin aggregates a candidate's ""implicit"" professional activity from the skills and interests they reveal across social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Meetup, Quora, and more, coupled with activity on other industry-specific social communities like GitHub, SourceForge, and Bitbucket for software engineering, for example. This additional information bolsters passive professional profiles with input that is vital to helping recruiters determine ideal job fit. The result is a more accurate, 360-degree view of a candidate that covers everything from professional skills to personal interests, information that does not usually appear on resumes or online professional profiles. TalentBin then takes it one step further, compiling all contact information such as email addresses, Twitter handles, and more to help facilitate direct candidate engagement.TalentBin offers an API for seamless integrations with a wide range of software partners. The TalentBin solution already has over 200 million candidate profiles cultivated from the US Patent Database and over 30 professional social media communities, and growing. To make TalentBin a part of your talent sourcing and acquisition strategy, visit www.talentbin.com.About TalentBinBased in San Francisco, TalentBin is focused on turbo-charging talent acquisition for recruiters and hiring managers with its talent search engine, turning the web into a virtually endless talent sourcing database.

Sales of two of Lilly's key drugs, Trulicity and Alimta, fell short of Wall Street's forecasts. Merck's earnings got a slight lift from sales of cancer immunotherapy drug Keytruda and vaccines — amid the worst measles outbreak since health officials declared the disease eradicated from the U.S. in 2000.Health care has been the worst-performing sector in the stock market this year on concerns about drug price reform and ""Medicare for All"" proposals from Democratic lawmakers. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund, an ETF that tracks the health-care industry's biggest companies, had risen by just 2.7% year to date as of Monday, significantly lagging the broader market indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13% over the same period, and the S&P 500 was 17% higher.Eli Lilly posted earnings $1.33 per share on revenue of $5.09 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.31 a share on revenue of $5.12 billion.The company said it expects further price declines in the United States this year as well as increased competition from generics, including for erectile dysfunction drug Cialis.Trulicity, the company's top-selling diabetes drug, brought in $879.7 million in the quarter. That was an increase of 30% compared with the first quarter of 2018 but below the $952 million analysts had expected. Sales of cancer drug Alimta came in flat compared with last year at $499 million.The U.S. drugmaker now expects full-year revenue between $22 billion and $22.5 billion, lower than a previous forecast of of $25.1 billion to $25.6 billion. However, it raised its adjusted full-year earnings forecast by 5 cents to $5.60 to $5.70 per share.Lilly has been facing pressure from Congress to lower prescription drug costs. In March, the company disclosed for the first time what it charges wholesalers versus what many patients typically pay. It also announced plans to sell a half-price version of insulin injection Humalog.The company reported first-quarter earnings of $1.22 per share, beating analysts' expectations of $1.06 a share. Revenue came in at $10.81 billion, topping estimates of $10.48 billion.Merck said sales of Keytruda surged 55% in the quarter to $2.27 billion. Keytruda, which boosts the immune system to attack cancer, has driven growth for Merck and put pressure on Bristol-Myers Squibb's rival drug Opdivo.Merck's Gardasil vaccine to prevent certain types of cancer also had a good quarter with sales up 27% to $838 million. Sales of children's vaccines, which includes the company's MMR vaccine for measles, jumped 27% to $496 million.The drug giant raised its earnings guidance for the year. It now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share of between $4.67 and $4.79, up from its prior forecast of $4.57 to $4.72.Pfizer earned 85 cents per share in the first quarter, beating Wall Street estimates by 10 cents. The company reported revenue of $13.12 billion, higher than the $12.99 billion forecast.CEO Albert Bourla, who succeeded Ian Read on Jan. 1, shuffled the company's senior management team last year and is leading efforts to restructure the pharmaceutical giant into a more nimble company. Pfizer has been trying to bulk up its pipeline of drugs and therapies, especially in oncology, ahead of impending patent expirations.Pfizer's blockbuster drug Lyrica, which treats nerve pain and is expected to face generic competition this year, brought in sales of $1.19 billion.The New York-based drug company also raised its earnings per share forecast by a cent. It now expects between $2.83 to $2.93 per share.For more on investing in health-care innovation, click here to join CNBC at our Healthy Returns Summit in New York City on May 21.",12:25.4
476,Some voters are scared the coronavirus will stop them from casting a ballot,2020-06-01T20:01:48+0000,Yelena Dzhanova,"Erica Friedle had not missed a vote in seven years. Then came the coronavirus pandemic.Friedle told CNBC she didn't receive her absentee ballot for April's Wisconsin presidential primary. And now she fears that a lack of preparation by state officials and the continued threat of the disease might force her to sit out the upcoming November election in the swing state. As health officials predict that the pandemic might last into the fall, many states are beginning to plan for the likelihood of people opting to vote by mail instead of showing up in person, where the risk of contracting and spreading the coronavirus is greater. For some people, the coronavirus has made voting a nerve-wracking action. Some Americans and voting rights groups are concerned that the pandemic is forcing voters to choose between avoiding contact with people to stay healthy and exercising their right to vote. Come November, these concerns might linger.""Are people going to want to stay in line to vote? Are people going to be requesting absentee ballots? Do people even have the technology to request a ballot online?"" Friedle asked, listing out some of her immediate worries in an interview with CNBC. ""There are so many unknowns right now.""The Wisconsin primary in particular has been criticized for its disorganization and last-minute changes, leading to voter confusion and disenfranchisement and serves as an example of what voting rights groups hope will not happen in November.Complicating matters, President Donald Trump and members of the Republican Party are on the attack against widespread mail-in voting while Democrats push for expanded access. Late last month, Trump threatened to withhold funding from Michigan and Nevada for expanding their mail-in voting services in an effort to avoid crowded polling centers during the coronavirus pandemic. ""More and more states are allowing vote-by-mail without voters having to provide a reason or excuse for it,"" said Andrea Hailey, CEO of Vote.org, a nonprofit focusing on advancing voter ballot access. ""Other states are mailing applications to voters, which is critical for ensuring that all voters can participate in the electoral process.""More than half, or 54%, of Americans said they would back voting by mail in the upcoming presidential election if the pandemic persists, according to an April Morning Consult poll. And 66% of surveyed Americans said in March that they were concerned about voting in person during the coronavirus outbreak. ""We are seeing signs that voters are registering at numbers unseen from our organization, and that they are very much interested in voting by absentee,"" Hailey told CNBC in an email.But mail-in voting can bring its own concerns, especially if there are underlying circumstances that affect support, such as the potential for U.S. Postal Service operation failure or miscommunication between state officials and voters.Friedle, a second-grade teacher, said she applied for an absentee ballot but did not receive it ahead of the Wisconsin presidential primary on April 7. She is a single mother with a 10-year-old child, sharing custody with her ex-husband, a scientist at a large pharmaceutical company who at the time of the primary had been working on a vaccine for Covid-19.The combination of being unable to leave her child alone and fearing getting sick at the polls made Friedle miss the vote.  ""I didn't want to put myself at risk for getting sick,"" she said. ""I've been taking care of my daughter the whole time. Her father works crazy hours, and at that time, he was telling me he might get locked out in his work, that he wouldn't be able to leave his work.""She added: ""That just made me nervous. Who's gonna watch my daughter?"" Friedle, 41, is not within the most vulnerable age group for contracting the most severe form of the virus. But there's still a lot at stake for people like Friedle: parents with young kids or teachers whose students are relying on them even as online classes persist. Knowing the risks, Friedle chose instead to skip out on voting. She feared if she contracted the virus, she would pass it on to her daughter or potentially be unable to teach. Voting rights groups stress that the most susceptible people are ""older voters and people with pre-existing conditions,"" according to Brett Edkins, political director at New York-based Stand Up America, a nonprofit focused on advancing Democratic goals. ""Children and younger parents are at relatively low risk of becoming seriously ill. Election experts across the partisan divide say that mail-in voting is the safest alternative to in-person voting.""But Friedle's experience during the Wisconsin primary gave her a taste of what November might look like for her and other voters across the nation, she said. She's hoping to see her state take action in the coming months to reduce the likelihood of people experiencing what she did. This includes ""having multiple ways to vote, whether you want to vote early, via an absentee ballot or in person.""At the same time, she's concerned about whether officials are considering the feasibility of these moves. ""How can we do that? How can we do it safely so people aren't being exposed to germs or viruses?"" she asked. ""Lots of organizations are out there that drive people to the polls. Are people still organizing these things with Covid going on?""In other states, some voters are concerned that there won't be enough done to make in-person voting safer. Angel Wells, a frequent voter and a self-described human rights activist based in Arizona, said that's what's driving her fears today. Voting can get chaotic in Arizona, said Wells, a veteran. In her voting area, ""there are 64 voting offices where you can cast your vote. But that's not enough when you live in a valley with millions of people.""""When people go out to vote, those lines are long. The polling booths are close [together]. They're not six feet apart. How are we supposed to have this vote and keep within health guidelines?"" ""People are rightly concerned about having to choose between their right to vote and their health,"" Edkins of Stand Up America said.

""I think we're hearing a lot of those concerns from our community and from voters everywhere.""Friedle's experience illustrates that much of the burden to acquire an absentee ballot was placed on her. She said she emailed the city clerk when she realized she didn't have her absentee ballot, asking for guidance in obtaining one. The city clerk shot back an email the day of the election, she told CNBC, attaching a ballot that needed to be printed, filled out and hand-delivered. Handing in the ballot wasn't worth the risk to her health, she said.The District of Columbia and 34 states, including five that conduct all-mail voting, use no-excuse absentee voting, according to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. But even so, a lot of those states don't typically send out absentee ballots unless a registered voter requests one. California is the most recent state to announce that all registered voters will receive a mail-in ballot for November's election because of the challenges brought on by the pandemic.At the same time, voting rights groups and registered voters recognize that there will be people still opting to show up and vote at the polls in November. ""Expanding vote-by-mail options is exactly what more communities need, but we must also ensure that it is safe to vote in person,"" said Vote.org's Hailey. ""That is why it should be a top priority for governments at all levels to fully fund our elections, that we have at least 20 days of early voting and that poll workers can conduct our elections in sanitary, safe conditions for our communities to vote in person as well.""That's the question many states are trying to answer right now, grappling with early preparations for the execution of the November election and trying to rethink voting. ""Nobody who's under 100 years old has run an election during a pandemic,"" Edkins of Stand Up America said. To decrease the risk of spreading the coronavirus, state officials are going to have to ""train on a very local level to prepare people,"" he told CNBC. That includes finding ways to maintain a standard six feet of distance between voters, having hand sanitizer and personal protective equipment readily available, regularly disinfecting voting booths and employing cough guards. Officials also have to take into account how volunteers and poll workers will engage with voters, Edkins said. It's important to remember to keep ""distance from voters who are often right next to poll workers verifying their signatures and signing them in to vote. I think they're going to have to think through all those procedures.""Already, there's been considerable advancement in the nationwide expansion of ballot access, Edkins said, adding that ""most states are making good progress.""""Multiple states have added Covid as a reason and an excuse to get an absentee ballot.""Many of the voting changes transcend party lines, Edkins said. Vote-by-mail expansion is coming ""not just from Democratic states, but also Republican states with local election officials that are making these changes as well."" It's too early to tell how these changes will affect voter turnout in November. For some voters, the concern is that these changes may not be enough to get the highest participation level possible. ""Voting is incredibly important,"" Friedle said. ""It's our opportunity to put people in power to make a difference. The people who are making those choices have an impact in my life.""",12:25.6

""This content, this different approach is going to have an impact and I think that that could be a similar size as Netflix, call it $15 billion a year""Munster is projecting the four services together will yield about $20 billion or so in revenues in the next five years.—CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.Disclaimer",12:26.0

The outcome will shape Britain's political and economic future.Ahead of the start of negotiations, which could be triggered as early as Tuesday, a committee of lawmakers warned it would be a serious dereliction of duty if the government failed to plan for the possibility of not reaching an exit deal.""I don't think, firstly, that is remotely likely,"" Davis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, responding to the report. ""It's in absolutely everybody's interest that we get a good outcome.""Parliament's Foreign Affairs committee warned that a breakdown in negotiations would be a ""very destructive outcome"", causing economic harm to both sides as well as creating uncertainty and legal confusion for individuals and businesses.""The simple truth is we have been planning for the contingency - all the various outcomes, all the possible outcomes of the negotiations,"" Davis said. ""One of the reasons we don't talk about the contingency plan too much is that we don't want people to think 'Oh, this is what we're trying to do.'""Asked when May would trigger talks, Davis declined to name a specific date.""Each date has different implications in terms of when it could be responded to by the (European) council ... I'm not going to get into the details why, but there's politics in terms of achieving success.""Before May can begin negotiations, she must finish passing the legislation that gives her the right to formally notify the EU of Britain's intention to leave and start a two-year negotiating period as set out in the EU's Lisbon treaty.The laws are expected to be finalised in a series of votes early next week, which will test May's authority over her Conservative Party as she seeks to overturn changes made to the draft bill by parliament's upper chamber.The government suffered two heavy defeats in parliament during the legislative process, inserting conditions into the bill saying May must guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in Britain and give lawmakers more powers to reject the final terms she reaches with the EU. Facing a possible rebellion from Conservatives who want to vote on the final Brexit terms, Davis urged lawmakers to back May's Brexit strategy and overturn those changes because they would tie the government's hands in the negotiations.""What we can't have is either house of parliament reversing the decision of the British people - they haven't got a veto,"" Davis said.Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.",12:27.7

Thursday's results were a rare outright earnings miss.Google is increasingly pitting itself against rivals beyond its usual competitors Yahoo and Microsoft, as it ventures into smartphone operating systems, mobile advertising and other areas in search of future growth.Google, which has made a string of acquistions in recent months, added more than 1,100 employees to its payroll during the second quarter.Google's net earnings came in at $1.84 billion, or $5.71 per share, in the three months ending in June. That was up 24 percent from the same time last year, but lower than the rate of growth in the first three months of the year.Total revenue, including money that Google shares with Web site partners, was $6.82 billion in the quarter.In an encouraging sign for the overall economy, marketers paid more for the online ads that generate virtually all of Google's income. People also clicked on the ads more frequently.Those trends indicate more companies and shoppers are feeling a little better as they recover from the worst economic downturn in more than 70 years.- AP contributed to this report.",12:28.9

496,FOREX-Dollar firm vs yen and euro before U.S. jobs data,2012-11-02T15:33:00+0000,,"* Upbeat U.S. private payrolls data boosts dollar* Yen hampered by Japan's trade deficit, economic woes* Euro has been hit by Greek court ruling on austerity stepsLONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a near four month-high against the yen on Friday as investors bet on an upbeat U.S. payrolls report after private employers added jobs at the fastest pace in eight months. The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar on selling by long-term investors. The euro has also been under pressure since a Greek court ruled on Thursday that pension reform demanded by foreign lenders may be unconstitutional. That raised concerns about Athens' ability to implement the austerity measures needed to secure bailout funds. All these drove the dollar index to a seven-week high of 80.389, breaking above its 55-day moving average of 80.14. The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the day at 80.31 yen, just shy of last week's four-month high of 80.38. Traders reported an option barrier at 80.50 yen with hedge funds ready to buy the dollar on dips if the U.S. jobs numbers disappointed. A break of resistance at 80.60-65, a chart triple top marked between May and June and a 50 percent retracement of the dollar's March to September decline, could signal further gains. ``A good U.S. jobs number will no doubt give a leg up to dollar/yen,'' said John Hardy, currency strategist at Saxo Bank. ``From a medium-term view, we are bullish on dollar/yen and the pair has established a base around 79 yen for a rally to 88 yen in a year's time,'' he said. The yen has come under pressure because recent Japanese data and corporate earnings have been soft. Third-quarter economic output data, due on Nov. 11, is also likely to have contracted. Payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing said private employers added 158,000 workers last month, bolstering expectations that the non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT may beat forecasts. A Reuters poll forecasts a rise of 125,000 U.S. non-farm payrolls in October. The unemployment rate is seen ticking up to 7.9 percent. Any market reaction to the jobs data may be short-lived given the uncertainty of the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.EURO ZONE STRUGGLES Some, however, are less sure about a sustained rise in the dollar as investors fret over the so-called ``fiscal cliff'' of looming tax rises and spending cuts in the United States. ``Over the course of the next month we would expect to move lower in dollar/yen, any upside above 81 would be surprising driven by U.S. negativity surrounding the fiscal cliff,'' said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist at Rabobank. The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2885, a three-week low, as traders sold the single currency, triggering an option barrier at $1.2880. Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East investors were cited below $1.2850. However, the euro held within the $1.2800-3200 range seen since September, underpinned by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy bonds of indebted euro zone countries that seek aid. Signals in the option market showed the pair was likely to trade in a range in coming weeks. The one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar options fell to fresh five-year lows around 7.50 percent. Data on Friday showed peripheral euro zone countries were still struggling. Spain's manufacturing sector shrank last month at it fastest pace since July, while Italian factory activity shrank in October for the 15th month running.

The euro fell to a three-week low against the dollar on selling by long-term investors. The euro has also been under pressure since a Greek court ruled on Thursday that pension reform demanded by foreign lenders may be unconstitutional. That raised concerns about Athens' ability to implement the austerity measures needed to secure bailout funds. All these drove the dollar index to a seven-week high of 80.389, breaking above its 55-day moving average of 80.14. The dollar was up 0.2 percent on the day at 80.31 yen, just shy of last week's four-month high of 80.38. Traders reported an option barrier at 80.50 yen with hedge funds ready to buy the dollar on dips if the U.S. jobs numbers disappointed. A break of resistance at 80.60-65, a chart triple top marked between May and June and a 50 percent retracement of the dollar's March to September decline, could signal further gains. ``A good U.S. jobs number will no doubt give a leg up to dollar/yen,'' said John Hardy, currency strategist at Saxo Bank. ``From a medium-term view, we are bullish on dollar/yen and the pair has established a base around 79 yen for a rally to 88 yen in a year's time,'' he said. The yen has come under pressure because recent Japanese data and corporate earnings have been soft. Third-quarter economic output data, due on Nov. 11, is also likely to have contracted. Payrolls processor Automatic Data Processing said private employers added 158,000 workers last month, bolstering expectations that the non-farm payrolls report due at 1230 GMT may beat forecasts. A Reuters poll forecasts a rise of 125,000 U.S. non-farm payrolls in October. The unemployment rate is seen ticking up to 7.9 percent. Any market reaction to the jobs data may be short-lived given the uncertainty of the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.EURO ZONE STRUGGLES Some, however, are less sure about a sustained rise in the dollar as investors fret over the so-called ``fiscal cliff'' of looming tax rises and spending cuts in the United States. ``Over the course of the next month we would expect to move lower in dollar/yen, any upside above 81 would be surprising driven by U.S. negativity surrounding the fiscal cliff,'' said Christian Lawrence, currency strategist at Rabobank. The euro fell 0.4 percent to $1.2885, a three-week low, as traders sold the single currency, triggering an option barrier at $1.2880. Bids from Asian central banks and Middle East investors were cited below $1.2850. However, the euro held within the $1.2800-3200 range seen since September, underpinned by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy bonds of indebted euro zone countries that seek aid. Signals in the option market showed the pair was likely to trade in a range in coming weeks. The one-month implied volatility on euro/dollar options fell to fresh five-year lows around 7.50 percent. Data on Friday showed peripheral euro zone countries were still struggling. Spain's manufacturing sector shrank last month at it fastest pace since July, while Italian factory activity shrank in October for the 15th month running.

501,What to make of the Fed minutes: El-Erian,2013-11-20T17:45:52-0500,,"The minutes released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve are a must-read for those interested in the complexity of modern central banking—if only for the striking contrast between the milquetoast discussion of the economy and the many policy and market complexities.    There is little that is new or noteworthy in the sections on economic developments and prospects. The bottom line is also a repeat of what has characterized many post-global financial crisis minutes: a more muted immediate economic outlook (growth and inflation) coupled with somewhat greater optimism for the longer term—all on a baseline characterized by the usual references to ""modest,"" ""moderate"" and ""cautious.""   By continuing the practice of compensating for a somewhat softer short-term outlook with upward adjustments thereafter, the FOMC is sidestepping an issue that has now entered the mainstream lexicon with a bang because of recent remarks by Larry Summers and Paul Krugman. It's what's being called ""secular stagnation"" and what Pimco in 2009 labeled the ""new normal""—namely, a prolonged period of low growth and persistently slow job creation.    The minutes' rather subdued economic discussion contrasts with the large number of open policy (and therefore market) questions.    (Read more: Fickle Fed: Taper could arrive in 'coming months')   From the interaction between the two main tools (asset purchases and forward policy guidance) to the consideration of new ones (lowering IOER), and from how and when to taper to the best way to communicate with markets, the minutes paint a truly complicated policy mosaic. Further, it is one that is still in the making and whose ultimate shape—and therefore impact—is subject to considerable uncertainty.   The complexity also extends to the specification of the intermediate policy targets that are so crucial for fine-tuning the policy response and thus delivering desired outcomes. Specifically, Fed officials posed the legitimate question of whether the commonly followed unemployment rate overstates the improvement in the labor market and, probably more controversial, whether it makes sense to add an inflation floor.    Finally, the minutes suggest that this is a Fed that is contemplating not only what could go right if it continues on the current policy path but also what could go badly wrong.    For this reason, officials ""considered scenarios under which it might, at some stage, be appropriate to begin to wind down the program before an unambiguous further improvement in the economic outlook was apparent."" Why? Because of ""concerns about the efficacy or costs of further asset prices.""    Such complexity can paralyze market participants at a time when the Fed in particular and central banks in general continue to play an important role in asset price determination. Yet some aspects are less ambiguous.   (Read more: Good news: Bubble concern is at a five-year high)   Taken in their entirety, the minutes provide further support for a consequential hypothesis: As part of a forthcoming policy evolution, the Fed wishes to encourage markets to delink their assessment of the two main policy tools—thereby enabling Fed officials to strengthen forward policy guidance, reduce (very gradually and carefully) heavy reliance on balance sheet operations and avoid a repeat of the May-June disruptions to the functioning of markets.    Fed officials may even be tempted into cutting IOER as a way to help manage this tricky and uncertain policy pivot.  (Read more: Yellen must promote strong recovery)   This is the reason why Pimco stresses greater differentiation in portfolio positioning.   We have been favoring the front end of interest rate curves while shying away from the long end—a point that my colleague, Bill Gross, has stressed repeatedly in his writings and tweets. It is also why, given current price levels, we feel that risk assets are becoming consequentially more dependent on a proper recovery in fundamentals and not just continued policy support.    And it is why we believe that greater attention should be devoted to recent disparities in performance among and within some major asset classes.

""Both the UK and EU are clear this implementation period must be time limited and cannot become a permanent solution."" ""We are now approaching a crucial moment. There is no escaping the complexity of the task ahead of us. We must not only negotiate our exit from an organisation that touches so many important parts of our national life, we must also build a new and lasting relationship while, given the uncertainty inherent in this negotiation, preparing for every scenario.""""We will need an arbitration mechanism that is completely independent, something which again is common to free trade agreements. This will ensure that any disagreements about the purpose or scope of the agreement can be resolved fairly and promptly.""""We will also want to explore with the EU how the UK could remain part of the EU agencies, such as the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries. ""We would of course accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those organisations and making an appropriate financial contribution.""""Yes there will be ups and downs in the months ahead.

""We will move forward by calm patient discussion of each other's positions.""""We have a shared interest in getting this right so let's get on with it.""""No we won't think again on Brexit. The British people voted for Brexit and I think it is incumbent on their politicians to deliver on the decision that we asked them to take.

""Successive British governments have worked tirelessly together with all the parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish government to bring about the historic achievement of peace. This is an agreement that we have all worked hard to protect. That is why I have consistently put holding up the Belfast agreement at the heart of our approach. ""Our departure poses particular challenges for Northern Ireland and for Ireland. We joined the EU together 45 years ago and it's not surprising that our decision to leave has caused anxiety and a desire for concrete solutions. ""We have been clear all along that we don't want to go back to a hard border in Northern Ireland. We have ruled out any physical infrastructure at the border and related checks and controls, but it's not good enough to say ""we won't enforce it if the EU forces Ireland to do it, that's down to them"". We chose to leave and we have a responsibility to help find a solution. But we can't do it on our own, it is for all of us to work together. And the Taoiseach and I agreed our teams should now do just that.

Yes there are some areas where, and ultimately parliament will always be sovereign, and it will be parliament that will make these decisions. There are some areas, as I've set out in the goods, er descriptions of goods, where from an economic point of view, businesses say it makes sense for us to operate on very much the same basis so that we can continue that good trading relationship, but the decision on those rules of course will be for parliament.""",12:30.8

For a trader looking at every short-term opportunity to move portfolio money to where the next quick buck is likely to be, it doesn't take more than that ""sell on the news"" headline. Longer-term investors, though, might want to consider a recent fact about the company and negative headlines: Apple has overcome pretty much every short-term ""sell"" headline in recent years on its way to being a $2-trillion-plus company.Trump's trade war with China? No problem. The surprise decision to stop offering iPhone unit guidance? Much ado about nothing as the iPhone super-cycle came along anyway. As for the global semiconductor chip shortage now being cited by Apple, it might be wise to keep in mind that Apple has a long history of being pretty conservative with its outlook — formal earnings guidance still has not returned. And one more thing: Tim Cook was elevated to the CEO post after Steve Jobs based on his mastery of global logistics.""Let's face it, if Apple has any trouble getting chips, then every other company on the planet will have 10x those problems,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

""If you're really worried about chip supply, you want to own Apple because it is first in line at every chip fab.""But there is a bigger question relevant to Apple and the rest of the market: Just how strong is the next leg of growth for the market going to be?The immediate outlook for the market doesn't necessarily scream buy-on-the-dip after the big tech sell-on-the-news, according to Colas. Seasonality is an immediate risk, with market history showing the early August period to be a volatile one for the VIX volatility index.""It's a valid trading question, where to go for the trading dollar in August,"" Colas said.Since 1990, the early August period has been one into which the VIX peaks. Part of the reason is the lighter volumes in the market during the summer. ""It's a trough for liquidity, when people are on vacation ... a lower number of people trading and more volatility any news item will carry. I am telling clients to be careful,"" he said.On Wednesday through Friday of last week, the S&P 500 trading volume was below its 30-day average.For the short-term trader, a rotation away from the large-cap leaders into small-cap represented by the Russell 2000, which Colas described as being ""way oversold"" since its torrid hot streak in early 2021, could make sense. ""Small-caps went parabolic through March and April and have not worked since because they got so far ahead,"" he said.That makes them, at least statistically, based on 100-day trailing returns, cheap right now.But for investors not playing the market for a quick trade, Colas says the post-earnings disappointing trades from Apple, Facebook and Microsoft shouldn't weigh too heavily. Amazon was the outlier in actually missing revenue expectations rather than posting a big beat, making a selloff on the news a ""fair"" reaction, according to Colas.It's also important to remember that the big beats from the rest of big tech were already embedded in most of the stocks as they had a strong June and July based on the market guessing right — that Q2 earnings would be stellar. ""The market was bidding up the names into the quarter. The market sniffed out the surprise and they all occurred, and when you see stocks all rally into a quarterly earnings, it's just hard to sustain that. That is 'sell on the news' unless there is a tremendous amount of good news and guidance,"" Colas said. ""That's normal capital markets behavior.""He goes back to one important data point in assessing the strength of these companies: they have doubled their earnings power in the past two years. ""Which is astounding,"" he said. And that gives him more comfort in the longer-term picture. ""I don't see any change. Big tech is still the place to be.""He cited two reasons.Even as these companies have doubled earnings growth, he doesn't think they are anywhere near peak earnings. ""It's just a much higher base to build on.""Second, these companies have definitive advantages in industries and don't directly compete against each other in a zero-sum game i many areas of strength.These companies have grown earnings so much because the pandemic changed consumption patterns, made us all even more tech-centric, and the market made a lot of money betting on that playing out exactly as it did. But now the big question for big tech isn't about its dominance being threatened — though multiple antitrust battles loom — it is just figuring out how much more room they have to keep the earnings growth rate going higher.""Tell me what you would pay for a company with a 30% return on investment and structural growth of 10% to 15%, and can do it for a decade? What is the multiple? Is it 30 times or 40 times? I have no idea,"" Colas said, ""but I know it's not 20 times.""Apple was an example from this group of concerns about price-to-earnings multiples. It lagged the rest of the tech giants for years, seen as a hardware vendor and weighed down by that market view until the services business soared through the pandemic and the $2 trillion market cap was given to the company. And again this year, it was ""the one oddball laggard,"" in Colas's words, as its year-to-date return into earnings was roughly 10% versus roughly 30% for Facebook and Microsoft.Apple trailed the S&P 500, too, ahead of the earnings. One reason: it sucked so much demand forward investors are rightly concerned posting good earnings comps will get harder. But, Colas said, that might also mean it has the most room left to go up, even in the short-term as a new iPhone launches in the fall and back-to-school boosts spending on consumer tech.The broader global growth story the entire stock market is tied to isn't a lock. In fact, amid the panic over inflation earlier this year and expectations that the 10-year Treasury yield would go higher, it did the opposite. ""The market totally understood growth had peaked in Q1 and started trending down at the end of the quarter,"" Colas said.The rate story was wrong, but slower economic growth is now higher up on the list of investor concerns for a U.S. market where P/E ratios are high. Big tech represents 23% of S&P 500 and that means whatever the market next decides about its lofty valuations will weigh on U.S. stocks overall.But investors don't have that many great choices globally. With the situation in China between the government and its leading companies resulting in massive losses in recent weeks, there might be trading opportunities, but emerging markets are no place to be for anything but a trade. And even if there is potential opportunity in other international plays like European financials, it is going to take time for rates to move in a direction that benefits those stocks.""What's left? It's U.S. and the top of the cap table,"" Colas said. ""That's what you need to own. Still back to the same names.""Looking at sector weightings back to the 1970s and through the 1990s, he says there has never been a time when five companies had more weighting. ""It's just 5 names, and it's not like when Exxon was at its peak in the S&P. That was a commodity play. These companies have huge barriers to entry and very high structural returns.""Even with those advantages, trying to figure out what their earnings power will be post-pandemic, or at least as the world transitions from the worst of the pandemic to the lingering effects, is the bigger issue for big tech.""What is a fair growth rate for 2022? That is hard,"" Colas said.For Alphabet — the only among the big tech names to report last week which rose after its earnings — and for Facebook, which reiterated a prior warning of slowing revenue growth, there is the cyclical nature of advertising market to rely on, and that has not changed all that much in recent decades. Apple, though, is a harder one, because even as it has made progress moving past the iPhone story and building its services business into a huge driver of growth, so much hardware demand was pulled forward.For Amazon, Colas noted that e-commerce's share of demand when from 17% to 24% in Q2 2020, and then back down to 20%. And every percentage point in that band has huge leverage over Amazon's business model  — in fact, he pointed to it as a reason why Amazon had been ""stuck in that band"" for nine months before it rallied into earnings. From October 2020 to June of this year Amazon had bounced around but didn't get bid up like the other names until the pre-earnings run. Year-to-date after its earnings fall, the stock is barely holding onto a gain, just under 3%.What just occurred in all of these stocks was a peaking into earnings, but it's nowhere near peak earnings for these companies, Colas said. The concept of peak earnings, which has been a concern for investors, implies there is a point in the cycle when a company shows its highest earnings growth in absolute terms. ""That's what peak earnings are about, and no big tech company is near peak earnings on an absolute basis,"" Colas said. ""Because they continue to grow and their amount of earnings leverage is massive.""That is more likely to be a buy on the future after the sell on the news has worn off.",12:31.9

The prior month was revised lower to show a 5.26 million-unit pace.This came a day after Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig said housing prices are likely to stay low for some timeand Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said the U.S. housing market is already in a double-dip recession.David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, went even further, using the ""D"" word in reference to the entire economy — not just the housing sector.""[W]e are finally exiting the denial stage and heading towards acceptance,"" Rosenberg said in a note to clients. ""[T]his is a depression, and not just some garden-variety recession."" He argues that the Obama administration's stimulus measures aren't working and when the U.S. moves away from them, then they ""will likely have much more reason to turn optimistic.""Of course, doom is a two-sided coin: Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said Europe is at risk for a double-dip recession because of all the austerity measures there, in an interview with a radio station in Ireland.The market's decline had initially accelerated after the housing report but soon snapped back as some pockets of gains began to emerge, most notably, in housing stocks. DR Horton, Pulte and Beazer were among the biggest gainers in the sector.Among other notable gainers were Verizon and AT&T, Walmart and Transocean.Medtronic skidded after the medical-device maker reported its earnings rose but sales fell amid softness in the global health-care market.On the M&A front, Dell  may raise its $18-a-share bid for 3Par  to match or exceed Hewlett-Packard's  $24-a-share counter offer, according to reports. Technology, along with financials and industrials, has been leading the market lower in its August slump. Market pros are getting increasingly worried about tech as even sector darling Apple has struggled. Apple shares are down over 1 percent today and have underperformed in the past month.Analyst Dennis Gartman, in his daily Gartman Letter, noted Tuesday that ""since mid-June Apple has not only failed to make new highs, it has made lower highs and now lower lows. Having closed at $246 last evening, more than 10% below its all time high, the chart looks ominous.""The latest news on the Potash front is that Rio Tinto may bid for fertilizer maker, along with a Chinese partner. Potash is talking with other potential suitors in a bid to get a better price than the nearly $39 billion being offered by Australia's BHP Billiton.Genzyme  and Sanofi-Aventis  are continuing discussions about a Sanofi takeover of Genzyme, though they still haven't agreed on a price, according to the Wall Street Journal.Pfizer  shares slipped after the company said its lung cancer treatment Sutent failed to meet its goal for longer overall survival in a late-stage trial.And Borders Group's chief financial officer Mark Bierley resigned to take another job, shortly after the book retailer named a new chief executive officer.This Week:TUESDAY: 2-year Treasury note auction; Earnings from Burger KingWEDNESDAY: MBA mortgage applications, advance report on durable sales, new home sales, weekly oil inventories, 5-year Treasury note auction; Earnings from BHP Billiton, Toll BrothersTHURSDAY: Weekly jobless claims, 7-year Treasury note auction.FRIDAY: GDP, corporate profits, consumer sentiment; Earnings from TiffanyMore From CNBC.com:15 Biggest Box Office Bombs of All TimeAmerica's Deadliest Jobs 2010Summer Reading: The 10 Best Books for Business",12:32.0

512,UPDATE 2-Serb central bank raises key rate to 10.75 pct,2012-10-09T13:32:00+0000,,"* Rate rise of 25 basis points tied to inflation, retailprices hike   * Future policy moves hinge on inflation, fiscalconsolidation(Updates with IMF report, background)   By Aleksandar Vasovic   BELGRADE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Serbia's central bank raised itsbenchmark interest, already the region's highest, by 25 basispoints to 10.75 percent on Tuesday, reflecting rising inflationand debt concerns.   Other central banks in Central and Eastern Europe have cutrates over the past two weeks, as growth slows across theregion, although Poland bucked the trend last week by keepingrates flat due to concerns over inflation.   Serbia stands out as an exception because of a cocktail ofrising inflation and debt and an economy sliding into recessionamidst crisis in the euro-zone, its main trading partner.   ""Considering that the increase of food prices andstate-controlled prices is higher than expected and thatinflationary expectations are on the rise, the Executive Boardhas decided to increase the benchmark rate  toprevent the spillover... to other prices,"" the Serbian bank saidin a statement.   Serbian inflation in August rose to 7.9 percent, up from 6.1percent in July, due to a poor harvest and the government's bidto finance its 2012 budget gap amounting to 6.2 percent of GDPthrough a rise in value-added tax.   The central bank estimates that inflation should continue torise until mid-2013 and then slide back to its target band offour percent, give or take 1.5 percentage points, the same asfor 2012. However, some analysts voiced caution.    ""That inflation is not driven by demand ... in that sense,the monetary policy is powerless,"" said Miladin Kovacevic, ananalyst with the Belgarde-based Economics Institute.    Djordje Djukic, a lecturer of economics with BelgradeUniversity, said Tuesday's rate hike was beneficial forportfolio investors, ""who will make profits on short-termmaturities, but bad for budget and debt"".   ""The effects (of the rate hike) on inflation are veryuncertain as the Serbian economy is highly monopolised andplagued by high production costs, low productivity andcompetitiveness,"" Djukic said.   RISING DEBT   The deficit, inflation and rising social discontent haveprompted the coalition government of nationalists andSocialists, which came to power in July, to borrow more. Thatincluded a Sept. 27 issue of a $1 billion Eurobond and a $1billion loan from Russia, planned for this year and next.   Serbia's total public debt this year is expected to reach 60percent of GDP and the country wants a new stand-by loan dealwith the International Monetary Fund to reassure investors.   The Fund froze a 1-billion euro ($1.30 billion) loan dealwith Belgrade in February over inflated spending and debt andtold Serbia last month to restore the autonomy of the centralbank and rein in spending before any new loan talks.   In its October World Economic Outlook, the lender saidSerbia's economy was expected to contract by 0.5 percent thisyear and grow 2 percent in 2013.   In the statement, the central bank said its future policymoves would depend on inflationary expectations, externalinfluences and the effects of fiscal consolidation.

It may feel like a big deal at the time, but it probably isn't. In terms of problems, traffic is a 1. The rational part of our brain knows that.

That camera can also recognize each member of your family's face, so it can display unique information for each person it sees.Here's what you need to know.I like the big screen on the Nest Hub Max, since I was able to watch a football game in the kitchen and still see the score. The bigger screen makes it easier to see menus, too, if you use the Hub Max for recipes (I'm a terrible cook, so I didn't try this) and for viewing photos.That's one of the best parts of the Hub and Hub Max: It serves as a great digital photo frame for displaying any albums you want from Google Photos. My wife and I love seeing old memories pop up on the regular Hub when we walk into the kitchen, and now they're even bigger.There's a built-in wide-angle camera that lets other people easily see you during a Google Duo video call. It follows you around the room, too, so you can walk and talk at the same time, much like the video chat feature on the Facebook Portal.You can call people who have Duo installed on either an iPhone or an Android phone, and it's free. One problem, though. I tried calling someone on Duo who was using a phone rather than another Nest Hub Max, and the video on my end wasn't good, even with the big display.They were able to see me and my entire kitchen, though, which means they benefited from my better camera. I think video chats would be most appealing between two Nest Hub Max owners, so I want to get a couple for my family over the holidays.The camera can be added to your Nest account to double as a security device when you're away. I set it so it turned off when I was home, but it automatically switched on when I was away to let me check in on the kitchen from my smartphone. You can get alerts if someone walks into the room, and it synced well with my existing in-home and outdoor Nest cameras. If you're worried about the camera, you can turn it off. There's a switch on the back of the Hub Max to turn the camera and the microphones off. Google says it's a hardware switch, so, in theory, someone can't hack in and turn it back on.Google Assistant is built in, so you can ask it to play music on Spotify, launch YouTube videos, play TV channels from YouTube TV, check the weather, call people and more. It understood me really well, even when I was across the room. And when you're blaring music, you can pause it by simply holding your hand in the air, or resume it doing the same gesture. This also works for timers, if you don't want to talk to Google but have a bunch of cake batter on your hands.One of the most unique features is also a bit worrying, though.The Nest Hub Max's camera can be used to recognize anyone who walks in the room. One morning, it showed me how long it was going to take me to get to work, recommended YouTube videos and Google News catered to me. It could do the same for my wife, switching up all of that information when it recognized her face.Except my wife won't register her face. Even though Google says it keeps your facial recognition data locked down to the device and doesn't use it for anything else, I'm a bit skeptical. For one, you need to register your face on a phone, so it has to travel to Google's servers first before it lands on the Hub Max. My wife told me she thinks it's ""creepy."" Maybe your family will feel differently, but Google hasn't gained everyone's trust yet.The speakers sound just OK. For $229, I expected something better, but they get irritating at high volumes. They're fine for just playing casual music in the kitchen, but you won't want to replace your Sonos speakers for this. That's kind of annoying, since I now have to keep a Sonos speaker in the kitchen in addition to a smart display, just to make sure I have good music in the room everyone hangs out in.I like it a lot. The Nest Hub Max is a big screen for viewing photos, recipes, TV shows, your schedule and more, all wherever you decide to plug it in. It works well at what Google says it can do: The cameras are solid, it connects to Nest just fine, it's good at recognizing my face (even if it's creepy to my wife) and it's priced well for what you get. I like the information more than what the Echo Show can provide, but you should stick with that if you're already an Echo household. If that appeals to you, then yes it's a good buy.If you're not wild about the $229 price and don't care about the camera features, then give the regular Nest Hub a try. It has a smaller 7-inch screen, costs $129 and is often on sale for about $99 but does most of the same things that the Hub Max can do.Follow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech product news.",12:32.6

The company’s a leader in both the private-label and brand-name markets, he said, and the stock “has the potential to explode higher.”American Italian Pasta  is North America’s largest dry pasta maker and the largest private-label pasta maker in the U.S. The company’s name brands include Heartland, Golden Grain and Muellers among others, but also provide private label Great Value Pasta to Wal-Mart. In fact, AIPC is Wal-Mart’s sole supplier of pasta, which accounts for 22% of the discount giant’s sales, and that’s a huge boost to business.The company gets 50% of its total volume from private-label sales and 67% of retail-sales volume. AIPC commands between two-thirds and three-quarters of the retail private-label past market. And management is putting its focus on developing its private-label products. As Cramer called it, AIPC is king of cheap pasta.Declining raw costs will also be a boon to American Italian Pasta. Cramer expects the benefits from lower wheat prices to kick in by the second half of this year. Investors who like AIPC’s story should be in ahead of that.The stock makes sense because pasta’s a cheap, easy dish for those who want to save money by eating at home. That’s why AIPC is up to $30 from $4 in the past year. But this is a small company with a market cap of only about $600 million. Only four analysts cover American Italian Pasta. And because of the big run, investors should at least wait for a pullback before buying. The stock’s cheap on a price-to-earnings basis, but that doesn’t always matter with these smaller names. So use limit orders, Cramer said, and never buy all at once.Cramer's charitable trust owns Wal-Mart.Questions for Cramer?

The Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO), which has seen multiple delays since it was first suggested in 2016, would be the world's largest.""We are ready whenever the shareholders decide it is the time to list,"" Nasser said.Aramco is expected to file its IPO prospectus by the end of this month, according to reports.The kingdom reportedly plans to list 1% of Aramco on its local stock exchange, the Tadawul, before the end of this year and another 1% in 2020 as first steps ahead of a public sale of roughly 5% of the company. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has estimated the firm's value at $2 trillion, while analysts put the figure closer to $1.5 trillion.The success of the IPO depends in part on the oil price, which is down some 30% in the last year, despite heightened geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region.Brent crude futures were trading at $58.78 a barrel on Wednesday morning at 11:15 a.m. London time, up nearly 1% from the previous day. Still, the international oil benchmark's price is now lower than it was the day before the Aramco attacks, which Riyadh and Washington have blamed on Iran, a charge Tehran denies.There are ""many factors"" impacting the oil price today, Nasser told CNBC's Sedgwick, noting that the global economic situation as a whole was affecting crude prices. ""I think market was very satisfied with Saudi Aramco's response (to the attacks), but also... there is a tariffs dispute ongoing between two super global economies. All of these things are impacting price of crude.""The CEO added that there is ample oil supply on the market, and that he expects demand to average at 1 million bpd.In earlier comments Wednesday, Nasser said that there was ""no doubt"" Iran was behind attacks on Saudi Arabia, which struck multiple points at two of Aramco's largest facilities: Abqaiq, the largest crude oil processing and stabilization plant in the world, and Khurais, the kingdom's second-largest oil field.Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have been at war with the Saudis since 2015 and are backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the strike, but numerous Western governments and security experts say the rebels could not have carried out such a sophisticated attack.In late September, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Saudi Arabia's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating from A+ to A, citing the ""vulnerability of its economic infrastructure"" and ""deterioration in Saudi Arabia's fiscal and external balance sheets."" Riyadh was quick to reject the downgrade, calling it ""somewhat speculative.""The Aramco IPO is part of the kingdom's Vision 2030, an initiative spearheaded by the 34-year-old crown prince to diversify the country's economy and reduce its reliance on hydrocarbon revenues.",12:33.2

Instead, it was a winding road of his greatest hits — the  same riffs that earned him notoriety through the primaries and  were pillars of his general election message, despite the efforts  of advisers.  Assuming the stage for his fifth appearance of the day, Trump  seemed worn but kept his usual confidence including the classic  call-and-response: ""Who's going to pay for the wall?

""We are hours away from a once in a lifetime change,"" he said.  Trump swore an end to Syrian refugees being let into the U.S. and  laid the groundwork for ""a lot"" more visits to the Mitten state  as he works to bring jobs and factories back here.  A woman walking by the press pen apologized for fellow Americans  who have lashed out over the course of the campaign. ""You don't  deserve it,"" she said, before admitting she was attending as a  Hillary supporter simply to confirm her choice. After her, a man  passed and pointed to the press: ""You're terrible.

""Just the thought of it made me physically ill,"" the billionaire shares in his ""Getting There"" essay. ""I would literally throw up.""Who would have thought that one of the most successful investors in the world once had a fear of public speaking?The Berkshire Hathaway CEO divulges that he purposely selected courses in college where he didn't have to stand up in front of the class and arranged his life so that he would never find himself in front of a crowd. If he somehow found himself in that situation, he admits that he could 'hardly even say' his own name.During Buffett's time at Columbia Business School, he saw an ad in the paper for a Dale Carnegie public speaking course for college students. ""I figured it would serve me well,"" he recalls. ""I went to Midtown, signed up and gave them a check. But after I left, I swiftly stopped payment. I just couldn't do it. I was that terrified.""After he graduated, Buffett returned to Omaha and got a job as a salesman of securities. But the problem still lingered: ""I knew that I had to be able to speak in front of people,"" he writes. ""So again, I saw the ad in the paper and went down to sign up; but this time, I handed the instructor $100 in cash.

""When capital markets are this loose, people tap them, whether  it's right to or not,"" said Mark Suster, a partner at the venture  capital firm Upfront Ventures. ""Companies are raising rapid  rounds of capital for only one reason: They can.""  The frequency of the fund-raising by many start-ups — now  multiple rounds in months rather than years — is ""otherwise  unheard-of,"" said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a  research firm that studies venture capital. More from The New York Times:An App That Helps Drivers Earn the Most From Their  Trips Uber Fund-Raising Points to $50 Billion  Valuation UberJoins the Bidding for Here, Nokia's Digital Mapping  Service  The shrinking time between funding rounds shows how Silicon  Valley's current boom is not just about start-ups reaching a high  valuation but also about how fast they can pull that off. The  tempo is in marked contrast to the pace of start-up fund-raising  last decade, when many companies would typically leave a year or  two between financing rounds. When LinkedIn, the professional  social networking company, raised money as a start-up in the  mid-2000s, it took more than three years for its first three  rounds of financing.  Since the beginning of 2013, however, more than 20 tech start-ups  have held three rounds of funding within a year and a half,  according to CB Insights, which called the group  the ""18-month sprint"" companies. Last  year, nearly 500 tech start-ups did financing rounds  less than one year apart, CB Insights estimated, more than any  other year since at least 2011.  Among the companies that completed numerous financings in tight  time frames was the fitness membership start-up ClassPass, which  completed three rounds in nine and a half months, CB Insights  said. Slack, the collaboration software start-up, last  month took in $160 million; just six months earlier, it had  received $120 million from investors. Snapchat in  December raised nearly half a billion dollars from a bevy of  financiers. Just three months later, the Chinese e-commerce  company Alibaba poured $200 million into the messaging start-up. Read MoreTravel hubs hitch a ride on Apple  Watch bandwagon  Spurring the more frequent fund-raising is the desire of  investors — including hedge funds, mutual funds and  strategic investors — to put up money more often for fear of  missing out on the next big thing. One reason Uber is in talks to  raise money again just a few months after a prior round is  because of an overwhelming amount of investor interest, said a  person with knowledge of the company who spoke on the condition  of anonymity because the process is confidential.  Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Many institutional funds and international companies have leapt  into start-up investing as the number of initial public offerings  has slowed, prompting investors to wade into private companies to  find growth, according to Mark A. Siegel, managing director at  the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has invested in  Uber.  ""I don't blame entrepreneurs,"" Mr. Siegel said. ""This is  something where investors are absolutely complicit in this, and  in some ways are driving this.""  He added that the phenomenon of fast fund-raising appears largely  limited to the club of ""unicorns,"" or the elite companies that  are worth at least $1 billion. Investments in the later financing  rounds for companies jumped to $4.2 billion in the first quarter,  up 50 percent from a year ago, according to data from the  National Venture Capital Association, making it the biggest  quarter for such investments since late 2000.  Entrepreneurs are often happy to take up eager investors on their  offers. Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, recently  said that his start-up had more than enough money in the bank  — just before collecting $160 million more.  ""This is the best time to raise money ever,"" he said last month.  ""It might be the best time for any kind of business, in any  industry, to raise money for all of history, like since the time  of the ancient Egyptians.""  Mr. Butterfield said Slack had ""no immediate use"" for the new  money it had just raised. Still, the capital ""reinforces the  perception for our larger customers that we'll be around for the  long haul,"" he said.  Parker Conrad, chief executive of Zenefits, said rapid-fire  fund-raising is necessary to quickly build up a company so it is  large enough to take on competitors. With the money, Zenefits has  been able to persuade more than 10,000 small and midsize  businesses to use its service.  ""We want to grow really big, really fast,"" Mr. Conrad said in an  interview last week for the company's third round of fund-raising since early 2014.  ""That requires a lot of capital.""  Even if the numerous rounds of new cash are not put to immediate  use, the money may come in handy one day if — or when —  the free-flowing capital faucets are shut off. Investors like  Bill Gurley, a partner at the venture capital firm Benchmark,  have warned of an eventual reckoning, a time when money  is not as easy to come by, which will cause some companies to  sputter out when their bank accounts empty. Read More  It is to protect against this inflection point that some  companies may be raising as frequently as they can, while they  can, said Mr. Suster of Upfront Ventures.  ""Some companies view these as war chests being raised to weather  the inevitable corrections,"" he said. ""For now, the tide is high  and nobody knows who's naked.""",12:34.0
527,Wealthy investors expect to earn average annual returns of 17.5%—here's why that may be too optimistic,2021-06-23T16:02:14+0000,Megan Leonhardt,"Wealthy Americans are pretty optimistic about their long-term investment returns, expecting to earn average annual returns of 17.5% above inflation from their portfolios.That's according to a new survey from Natixis that surveyed households that have over $100,000 in investable assets in March and April of 2021. Those same investors report they expect to earn 17.3% above inflation in 2021, which, while high, may be understandable. The S&P 500 price index returned 15.76% last year and the market was up 5.24% already when the survey was fielded.But longer term, earning an annual return that averages out to 17.5% above inflation year after year is an ""exceptionally high"" expectation, says Dave Goodsell, executive director of the Natixis Center for Investor Insight. These estimates are much higher than historical averages. For instance, U.S. stocks average 10-year returns of 9.2%, according to Goldman Sachs data.Financial advisors' estimates are also much lower. Advisors surveyed by Natixis are calling for more realistic expectations of 6.7% average annual returns above inflation.

He also argued then, and reiterated on Wednesday, that when he wrote ""pedo guy"" he meant ""creepy old man."" Musk also argued that, essentially, Unsworth picked a fight with him.Unsworth's attorney L. Lin Wood asked Musk on Wednesday whether Musk believed his ""pedo guy"" comment impacted Tesla shares. Musk said he had ""received concerned notes from shareholders."" The testimony ended with Wood asking about Musk's net worth. Over the objections of defense Alex Spiro, the judge allowed the question, saying ""Let's give everyone a headline.""Musk testified that he didn't know his precise net worth, and the value fluctuates on a daily basis. He said he owns stock in Tesla and SpaceX and has debt against his stock but he does not have a lot of cash. Asked if $20 billion was a reasonable estimate, Musk said he didn't know, but ""I think SpaceX and Tesla stock probably amount to that.""The dispute between Musk and Unsworth began in the summer of 2018, when Unsworth, a spelunker and expert diver, led the rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand.Before the rescue was completed, Musk had endeavored to involve himself, and employees from his companies SpaceX and Tesla, in the rescue. They created a rescue pod, or miniature submersible, that ultimately proved of no use in the rescue effort.Musk and his team pressured Thai officials to make favorable public statements about their involvement, while the rescue was still in progress and the boys' lives were at risk.Once the boys and their coach were safe, Unsworth was asked in an interview on CNN what he thought of Musk. He characterized Musk's efforts as a publicity stunt and said the Tesla CEO should ""stick his submarine where it hurts.""In court this week, Musk contended that when he called the cave rescue hero a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter, he was just responding to Unsworth's ""unprovoked attack,"" with similarly heated rhetoric, not meant as a literal accusation of pedophilia.At one point in his testimony, Musk said: ""I assume he literally didn't mean to sodomize me with a submarine. I literally didn't mean he was a pedophile.""Judge Stephen Wilson emphasized that the outcome of the defamation case hinges on whether or not a reasonable person, given context, would interpret the ""pedo guy"" tweet as Musk labeling Unsworth an actual pedophile.Unsworth will also have to prove that he suffered damages as a result of the alleged defamation.In court on Tuesday and Wednesday, Musk clashed frequently with Wood, to the point where the judge warned ""Let's cut the repartee. ...

But they are also introducing a slate of fees for items and services that used to be free, including SpiritAirlines’ new policy of charging up to $45 for one oversize carry-on bag.","cnbc, Articles, Howmet Aerospace Inc, Alaska Air Group Inc, American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp, Southwest Airlines Co, Ryanair Holdings PLC, Camden Property Trust, Inside American Airlines, Business News, Economy, US Economy, US: News, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Airlines are now touting their summer fares to lure travelers. But they are also introducing a slate of fees for items and services that used to be free, including SpiritAirlines’ new policy of charging up to $45 for one oversize carry-on bag.Ben Baldanza, president and CEO of Spirit told CNBC Wednesday that at the same time the company insituted the carry-on bag fee, it also lowered fares and checked-bag costs. As a result, he said, “Sales are up 50 percent.”  Spirit passengers are still allowed one carry-on for free, as long as the luggage fits under the seat in front of them. It's when the bag must go into the overhead bin that the fee is charged. The $45 fee applies at the gate; passengers are charged $15 less for the carry-on if they pay online or at the airport check-in counter.Most airlines charge between $20 and $30 for checked bags and allow two free carry-ons. As Reuters reported Wednesday, the airlines been shoring up their nearly bare coffers by introducing auxiliary sources of revenue by charging customers for items and services, while also cutting capacity and adjusting their business models; in the last few years, the industry has been hammered by the combination of unpredictable fuel prices, a poor economy that has hindered travel and competition from budget carriers.Spirit isn't the only airline getting more money from passengers: Travelers on other airlines now pay for in-flight blankets and pillows and even as much as $75 for an extra-legroom seat on a cross-country flight. As outrageous as it sounds, Ryanair, a budget European carrier, has revived its much-debated plan to charge for a trip to the restroom by using coin-operated toilets. JetBlue still gives you a free bag of blue potato chips, but it now charges for other perks, including, for April only at this point, whopping fees for extra-legroom seats. For a San Francisco to New York flight, for instance, more legroom will cost you $75 each way. According to JetBlue, the airline is trying the fee structure to gauge demand and determine whether to replace the longstanding fees of between $10 and $40 per flight. Here’s a sampling of other fees charged by airlines: Pillow and blanket, American, $8 Wi-Fi, through gogoinflight.com, $4.99 for 1.5 hours to $39.95 for a 30-day unlimited pass good for multiple airlines that include AirTran , American, Delta and Virgin America. “Deluxe” sandwich, $10, JetBlueHeadsets, $2, JetBlueFor a list of domestic baggage fees, check out airfarewatchdog.com’s chart (you can see it here).

It's just not a full-time gig.Like many other Americans, she  works part time and it's barely enough to pay for food, fuel and  shelter. Millions of Americans were working part time in November  but they would like to have been working full time. These  so-called ""involuntary part-time workers"" are an example of some  of the stubborn pockets of weakness that remain in the labor  market even as the jobs picture improves very slowly.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported Friday that nearly 8.2 million people  classified themselves as involuntary part-time workers in  November, meaning that they settled for less work because they  couldn't get more. That's around double the number of involuntary  part-timers in 2006, before the nation went into recession and  entered a prolonged period of weak recovery.  A separate group of more than 18 million people were working  part-time in November for non-economic reasons, either because  they are in school or they want to spend more time with their  children, for example.  The number of people who are involuntarily underemployed has gone  down since it hit 9 million in the depths of the recession, but  progress has been slow and rocky. 'A Demand Problem'  For people like Gray, 63, improvement can't come soon enough.  Gray, who lives in Cary, Ill., for years worked two jobs: a  full-time administrative job and, for extra money, a part-time  cashier job at a major home retailer. She was laid off from her  full-time position, which paid close to $16 an hour, in January  of 2012.  She was left with a part-time job that pays $12.40 an hour. That  plus some unemployment compensation she receives is barely enough  to cover her mortgage and other expenses. She sometimes relies on  her church for food, and worries what will happen when the  unemployment runs out at the end of the year.  She's spent nearly a year looking for another receptionist or  administrative position.  ""I'm on the computer, it seems, 24/7. I am networking. I've  walked out my resume to 83 companies,"" she said. She's also taken  classes on how to interview and on invoicing, and she plans to  take another one on PowerPoint.  She's had many job interviews in the past 12 months, but no  full-time job offer.  Gray said she can't work any more hours as a cashier because a  tumor on her foot makes it difficult to stand for a long  time.  According to her doctor, the mass isn't cancerous, she said, but  she can't afford to have it removed. Her insurance as a part-time  worker wouldn't be enough to cover the procedure and  rehabilitation.  Gray will turn 64 in February, which means she won't qualify for  Medicare for another year. Until then, she said, she needs a job  that offers health insurance.  She's hoping to avoid dipping into Social Security for as long as  possible because the longer she waits, the more she stands to  collect.  ""I was actually hoping to hang on until 70,"" she said.  She may still be in for a tough slog. Heidi Shierholz, a labor  economist with the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute,  said the basic issue plaguing involuntary part-time workers like  Gray is the same one plaguing the overall labor market: There's  just not enough demand to compel employers to add to their labor  costs substantially.  Shierholz said she expects involuntary part-time workers to  gradually see improvements but ""it is a going to take a long  time.""  ""I think by far the dominant reason that we aren't seeing  employment in both dimensions — full (time) people or  ramping up hours for workers that already are there — is  just a demand problem,"" she said.

Fiore, who lives in Nottingham, Md., lost her full-time job with  a long-term care company nearly two years ago, and has struggled  for more than a year to find another job.  A friend connected her with a small company that hired and  trained her for an accounts payable and receivable job. She works  about 25 hours a week and makes about half what she used  to.  Fiore, who turns 57 this week, and her husband struggle to pay  their bills. It's not the situation she envisioned they would be  in heading into their golden years.

We're going to start using Roman numerals, so it's VI.  We've had the privilege on five of -- this will be the fifth time  -- save one of our Delivering Alphas, each time we've had the  privilege of Treasury Secretary of the United States being with  us, back to Mr. Geithner's term and now, for the third time, the  76th Treasury Secretary of the United States, please welcome to  the stage, Jacob Lew and his interviewer, Steve Liesman, chief  economics correspondent for CNBC. Got to get the title right.  STEVE LIESMAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for continuing this  tradition of kicking off Delivering Alpha with us.  JACOB LEW: Great to be with you this morning.  STEVE LIESMAN: Am I right that you were just a little late  because you were meeting with the lyricist for the musical that's  going to be made with your tenureship? Is that right?  JACOB LEW: Just like every other New Yorker, I was stuck in  traffic.  STEVE LIESMAN: Will it be rap?  I want to start off with some of the headlines. I mean, it's been  a series of headlines from your brief, so to speak, over the last  several days.  This morning there's a story that an executive who oversaw some  of the places where there was alleged phony accounts created at  Wells Fargo made $125 million. Do you feel this is money that  should be clawed back or there should be systems in place to claw  this money back?  JACOB LEW: The consumer protection agency that took action  against Wells Fargo is an important new addition to our  protections for individuals and for the financial system. It  didn't exist before financial reform. I think they uncovered  practices that they have taken action against. I don't comment on  specific regulatory matters. But what I can tell you is what I've  seen from what they've done is bad behavior they were correct to  take action against. And how that flows through in terms of next  consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.  What I can tell you is there's a lot of talk in Washington these  days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law,  changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took  action against this. This ought to be a moment when people stop  and remember how dangerous the system is when you don't have the  proper protections in place.  This is something that our watchdogs found. If they were not  there, they would still be going on. This is a wake-up call. It  should remind all of us, and firms, that culture and compensation  make a difference. How you reward people, how you motivate  people, and what values you hold people to matter.  There's a public responsibility, and I think the CFCB took action  reflecting the public responsibility, and there's a private  responsibility. And we each have to do our part.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if culture and compensation make a difference,  then why wouldn't you support a clawback of this?  JACOB LEW: I'm not commenting one way or the other on the  clawback. I really am not going to comment on the facts of the  specific case. It's being reviewed by an independent regulator.  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to speculate on something that  I don't know all the facts of. I think I'm addressing the issue  in a pretty conclusive way. This is unacceptable behavior. And  it's the kind of behavior that we need to be able to catch and  stop.  STEVE LIESMAN: We've had billions of dollars of fines levied on  financial institutions. And still this behavior is still being  uncovered. Is Justice going far enough here? Do we need to be in  a situation where, for example, companies are not allowed to  plead that they didn't commit the alleged act and that there are  individual indictments brought? We haven't seen that in any of  these financial crimes, or very few of them.  JACOB LEW: We have, I think, taken action on a pretty dramatic  basis to put fines, penalties in place for firms that have acted  badly. The question of whether or not to pursue criminal  prosecution is a decision that prosecutors ultimately make. We  have made clear we don't believe that anyone is too big to jail.  It's up to prosecutors to decide how you pursue the criminal  charges. It's not up to regulators or the policymakers.  What I can say is that the pattern of behavior that we've seen  here is something that needs to stop. It is not acceptable to do  things that are designed to increase either an individual or a  firm bottom line by deceiving consumers and passing along charges  that are either invisible or they don't know about.  And this is not the same as a financial crisis issue. This is  really a consumer protection issue. I don't think this is a  moment where we have to ask the kinds of questions that we did in  2008 about what it means about the underpinnings of the financial  system. But when I hear people say we want to roll back the  statute that created the consumer protection bureau, this is yet  another proof point that it was the right thing to create, it's  the right thing to have an independent director, and it's the  right thing to make sure that there's somebody, and an entity  watching over our system, to make sure that individuals get clear  information about their financial products and, when firms or  individuals behave badly, that somebody finds out about it and  takes action.  STEVE LIESMAN: Moving to another company story which is in the  headlines, and you're doing specifically with this issue of  Apple, an attempt by the European Union to get 14 1/2 billion  dollars of back taxes.  Beyond the company-specific story, is this an attempt by the E.U.  to essentially grab unpaid American taxes?  JACOB LEW: You know, Steve, I have an op-ed this morning in the  ""Wall Street Journal"" where I went into some length describing  our views on this. But let me briefly reprieve what I've said on  this. We have for some time told the European Commission that we  believe that this is an inappropriate approach. Why is it  inappropriate? We agree with them that it's wrong for companies  to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to get to zero or very  low tax rates by taking advantage of tax havens.  But the action that the European Commission took is out of the  framework of normal tax policy, a retroactive tax that reaches  into another country, another jurisdiction's tax base, in order  to make sure that a firm pays its taxes. We agree with them that  firms should pay their taxes. But when it's U.S. income, we think  that that tax should be paid in the United States.  We've done a lot of work over the last two years to work on an  international basis to make sure that -- to share information  better. And we have an ability to close several loopholes that  have contributed to the erosion of tax bases around the world. We  need to take action in the United States to decisively change and  pushing firms to take their income overseas. We have a broken  corporate tax code.  We have the highest statutory tax rate in the developed world.  It's riddled with deductions and loopholes that give advantages  that we don't really need or would design for for today's  economy. And the result is we see U.S. companies trying to impart  income in lower tax jurisdictions.  Now, those lower tax jurisdictions are for doing some things that  aren't right also. The race to the bottom with low tax rates to  be a magnet for those companies, that has to change too.  But what action do we need to take in the United States? We need  to fix our tax system. We need to close the loopholes. We need to  lower the statutory tax rate. And one of the things that we've  proposed, which I believe is an idea that will still have  resonance in the year to come is that the revenue that we get by  putting a one-time tax on income that's parked overseas will  produce one-time revenue that ought to be used to fund an  investment in infrastructure in this country.  So we can do two things at the same time. We can fix a broken tax  code. We can make it so that our companies don't feel they have  to leave the United States to put their income overseas. And we  can fix our broken infrastructure.  What I don't think is right is for tax authorities and other  jurisdictions to reach into our tax base and to remove the  ability for us to execute what I just described.  STEVE LIESMAN: So if they're reaching in on Apple, are there  other company cases yet to come?  JACOB LEW: There are a number of pending matters --  STEVE LIESMAN: Pending, but what about ones that you think  there's going to be more of a grab at this point?  JACOB LEW: I can't speak to the European Commission, but we have  spoken on the policy. We don't address individual cases. As I  mentioned before, I'm not addressing the individual case that  they choose to act on.  STEVE LIESMAN: So does that mean you won't join as a party to the  case in Europe, to join as an amicus, so to speak?  JACOB LEW: Well, the European procedure is a little bit different  than ours. They are very aware of our views. We've submitted our  views in a pretty formal way. The parties here are the government  involved and the company involved. They've both indicated their  intention to appeal. And we've made our views known to the  authorities in Europe. And we've done it in a way that our views  will be before the commission on future matters as well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the tax rate, the right corporate  tax rate. 35% is the current top rate, just the federal part.  There's another six points or so according to the OECD that would  be added on some level. You proposed 28. It seems like the House  Republicans wanted 25, and Donald Trump wants 15.  15 would be toward the lower end of the OECD. 12 1/2 is Ireland.  Germany is around 15. Why wouldn't we want a rate that low that  would make America very competitive?  JACOB LEW: The principle that's driven our work on tax reform is  that it has to be revenue neutral. We are -- I don't think -- it  would not be right for us to have individuals pay more taxes for  us to lower the corporate tax rate.  What we've proposed doing is eliminating loopholes and deductions  and using the revenues that we get by doing that to reduce the  tax rate on the business side as much as we can. We got to 28%  essentially because that was the amount of loopholes that we  could close.  STEVE LIESMAN: I get what you're saying, and that makes perfect  sense on one side of the ledger. But the other side of the  ledger, at 28, you're still not competitive and there's still a  13-point incentive for companies to go overseas.  JACOB LEW: In the 25-28% range, we're getting pretty close to the  average. And a few minutes ago, I talked about the race to the  bottom. Some of the pressures on countries that cut their tax  rates to low rates in order to be a magnet, if we, as we have  discussed in the G20 and the OECD and other international bodies,  truly believe that we need to close down the pathways to tax  avoidance, we're going to need to conform to some norms. And  having countries go to very low tax rates is part of the problem.  We have our problem. We have a very high rate and a broken  system. We need to fix our system and take a look at theirs as  well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Is this a failure of the administration for  corporate tax reform here?  JACOB LEW: I actually think that if you look at the history of  tax reform, it often takes many years for it to kind of take  hold. And it's not unusual for it to begin in one administration  and finish in another. I feel we've made actually a great deal of  progress working through bipartisan conversations to build a  growing consensus around the kind of approach that I've  described.  I think that there's an environment now where the political  environment is not one where it has been ripe to take up  something like this. But the ideas that we've been promoting will  be the foundation for action in the future.  So I actually feel we've moved significantly toward tax reform.  You know, it takes a desire on the part of Congress to do  something hard. Hard things don't happen unless there's a real,  real desire to do it. And you need a partner. We have had  individual partners, but, as a whole, we have not had that  commitment.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if you look at this issue from outside the  Beltway, one guy is at 28, the other guy is at 25. Let's get in  the room, spend 7 minutes, and we'll make a deal. It seems like  you were impossibly close almost the entire time and didn't make  it down there.  JACOB LEW: You and I have discussed this a number of times,  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN: And I still don't have a good -- not from you, but  in general.  JACOB LEW: I do believe that the people that we've engaged with,  who have been leaders on the Republican side, now Speaker Paul  Ryan, some senators who have been engaged in it, we've had a lot  of conversations that lead me to believe there is the basis for  an agreement. I just think the time for that agreement is  probably not the next four months.  STEVE LIESMAN: Do you look back --  JACOB LEW: In terms of need to do it, you look at the  infrastructure component of this, I think there's an urgency  right now to dealing with infrastructure. You look at the action  taken by the European Commission, that's an urgency that we need  to act if we want to protect our tax base.  You have an alignment of forces right now that I think create a  real opportunity. And I certainly think that's an opportunity the  American people would be well served if Congress takes advantage  of.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Again, that's another program or effort by the administration,  worked hard on it, seemed to get agreement, and now can't get it  through Congress. Do you regret that? Is that a failure of the  administration?  JACOB LEW: Well, first, I wouldn't draw conclusions about what we  can and can't get through.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm watching my clock here.  JACOB LEW: There's still time for the TPP, Trans-Pacific  Partnership, to be approved.  Let's start with the substance. TPP is a good economic deal for  the United States. It's good for American workers. And it's good  for U.S. security interests in the world. It means that they will  have a more level playing field. American products and services,  which are best in the world, will be able to compete on stronger  ground. And it retains the U.S. leadership in the world on  important strategic issues.  So I think it's vitally important that we get it approved. I  believe there's still support for TPP. There's clearly opponents  of TPP. I can't question that. We've passed through the Congress,  about a year ago, the underlying legislation, Trade Promotion  Authority, which provides the procedural basis to approve TPP.  TPA, I believe, was a harder vote than TPP. It was an  abstraction; it wasn't a specific agreement.  I can point in TPP to how it strengthens labor standards, how it  strengthens environmental standards, how it raises business  practices closer to our own. I can point around the world to  countries that are already taking policy actions, whether it's  Mexico or Vietnam, to meet some of those standards.  I think we have the substance profoundly on our side. What I  think the challenge we have -- and this is a big challenge. We  can make the case that it will improve growth in the United  States, and more GDP should be good for everyone. Where we're  running into a problem right now is the sense that is not just in  the United States, but it's in other parts of the world, that  more growth does not necessarily mean better wages or better  opportunity for working people.  I think the issue that is the real issue that we're going to have  to deal with is to show how the benefit gets to individuals. And  that's bigger than TPP. I think we saw that in the United Kingdom  in the vote recently on the referendum.  STEVE LIESMAN: And that's a failure at every level of leadership,  when it comes to economic issues, the issue of trade and its  benefits. The support of the American people has eroded almost  across the board.  JACOB LEW: Right. But the point I just made, Steve, is it's  broader than trade. I think it gets to the question of a social  compact. I think it gets to the question of how free market  capitalism and liberal democracy thrives. We have to ask some  serious questions about what is it that's holding wages back?  What is it that's preventing individuals from feeling that they  have a share in growth?  I know what we can do at a public policy level. At a public  policy level, talking about infrastructure, and we talk about  skills. If you want to have working people feel that they have a  stake in the future, they have to have the skills to get jobs in  the economy of the future, and they have to have the ability to  get to and from home and work. And they have to see a growing  economy that's going to grow the kinds of jobs that they can take  advantage of. That's bigger than trade.  I think we have a confluence of things that have been going on  between technology and trade and the changing structure of our  economy that are making it a challenging moment. But TPP on its  face should be a clear plus. And we're going to continue to make  that case. And I think we're going to have to demonstrate the  commitment to working families.  STEVE LIESMAN: But, I mean, in that equation, you have to address  the omnibus criticism of the Obama administration, which was one  of regulation that tamped down on private enterprise, and too  much government intrusion into the private sector that really  kept some of the gains getting to individuals.  JACOB LEW: I think if you look at where the economy was when we  took office just under eight years ago, it was in the middle of  the greatest recession since the Great Depression. We were seeing  unemployment at 10%. There was no bottom. We put in place an  economic program that's lifted the United States out of that  recession. We've seen sustained growth. We've seen 15 million new  jobs. We're seeing wage growth. And some of these things that  you're just labeling regulation are also why we're able to be in  a place to meet our commitments to reduce our emissions and to  meet the standards to make this a safer world by having our  climate problems not engulf our future.  There's a lot of things going on inside the package that you call  just more regulation. This economy is a stronger economy because  of the policies we've pursued. It's not as strong an economy as  we would like to see. A lot of what I see as having held back the  U.S. economy is the headwinds internationally. We've seen  probably a half a percentage point of GDP shaved off the U.S.  economy because demand globally has been weak.  That's one of the reasons we put so much time into trying to help  move the global debate towards using more policy tools to grow  demand and grow the economy. And we've made progress there. I  think we've made real progress. You are seeing a number of  countries around the world put in place more aggressive policy  using fiscal tools as well as monetary tools.  So I think there's a lot of things going on. And I think right  now the United States is looked to in the world as being a  resilient economy that's bounced back. What I tell my colleagues  around the world is we can't be the only engine in the world  economy. There need to be multiple engines.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to get to the overall economy. But one of  the things you've talked about is this need to invest in  infrastructure. The Republican nominee has accomplished something  like half a trillion dollars for spending on infrastructure. Do  you think that's a good number?  JACOB LEW: I have to tell you, Steve, I haven't dissected any of  the campaign proposals. I'm not doing politics in my current  life. I'm happy to talk about our policies, but I haven't  actually taken apart the campaign proposals.  STEVE LIESMAN: Well, what's the right number for infrastructure  investment? I assume you're talking over a 10-year period.  JACOB LEW: Yeah, the right number is a very, very big one. We  have trillions of dollars that need to be invested. It's not all  public money. What we did a year ago, a little over a year ago,  is we extended our surface transportation funding for five years,  basically at level funding, a little bit of an increase. Enough  to maintain what we're doing now, not enough to build the new  facilities that we need to compete in the 21st century.  I think putting several hundred billion dollars of federal money  into a commitment on a multiyear basis to build infrastructure  would have an effect on state and local planning that would bring  more state and local resources to bear and, just as importantly,  would be a foundation for public-private partnerships, which is  what gives you the ability to leverage the amount of resource you  are putting in.  This is not all a question of just federal funding. But federal  funding has been the foundation. One of the things that we do is  we create a kind of certainty out there that there's steady flow  to get projects off the drawing board. Without that, the whole  system slows down. And I think we have taken some time off from  driving that process forward, not to the point that it's  irreparable, but we can't take another decade off.  STEVE LIESMAN: At the same time, when we look at overall economic  growth, we're doing just around 1% the last three quarters. How  much concern has this caused you that we can't even get to the  new lower new normal of 2%?  JACOB LEW: I think when you go quarter to quarter, sometimes you  can overexplain an individual quarter.  We've seen growth in the low 2% for a number of years now. We're  continuing to see strong labor markets. We're continuing to see  improvements in wage growth. Consumers in the U.S. are very  strong. Housing is doing better. Autos have been doing very well.  The weak spot on the economic picture is investment. And I think  that if we could figure out what it is that's going on in  investment and productivity to drive the investment numbers  forward, that would be very important. I mean, I think that there  is a lingering lack of confidence in the global economy coming  out of the economic crisis. It was a deep, deep economic crisis.  It left concern. How do you know we're not snapping back?  I think in the United States we've demonstrated pretty decisively  that we're not slipping back. There are other parts of the world  where every three to six months you wonder, is it going one way  or the other? There's a lot of geopolitical risks. I think we  have to stabilize those risks.  One of the things we do when we meet in the G20 is focus on that.  And just last week we met in China at the G20 leaders meeting.  And I think you heard a few things at that meeting that were  important and different.  One is what I just talked about in terms of inclusive growth, in  terms of everybody sharing in it. We used to be a chorus of maybe  one talking about inclusive growth. All the leaders were talking  about inclusive growth. I think there's a clear understanding  that we have to show that the benefits of growth get to working  people globally right now.  Secondly, there was a commitment to using all policy tools that  is much stronger than its been in the past, where heads of state  are talking about using the fiscal space they have more  vigorously. And I think on the exchange rate issues that have  been so vexing for a long time, we have a clear agreement to  refrain from competitive devaluation and to coordinate together  so that, at moments of volatility, we don't see unilateral  actions that destabilize the global economy.  STEVE LIESMAN: I just want to come back to one of the things you  just talked about, which is using the fiscal side.  Is the fiscal side getting a message from the monetary side that  there's only so far they're willing to go? Mario Draghi last week  suggested, you know, we're at a negative place. We don't want to  go more negative. Possibility of the feds discussing raising  interest rates. Is the fiscal side getting a new message from the  monetary side?  JACOB LEW: As you know, Steve, I don't comment on monetary  policy, particularly not fed policy.  STEVE LIESMAN: We're talking about fiscal policy.  JACOB LEW: I don't think that fiscal authorities needed messages  from anyone that the fiscal tools are important. We've been  delivering that message consistently since 2009. I've been doing  it as treasury secretary for the last three and a half years.  What we've seen over the last three years is a shift in the  debate.  When I became treasury secretary, there was a global debate about  austerity versus growth. We went to G7 and G20 meetings and there  would be debates about austerity versus growth. Those debates are  over. There is no more focus on austerity qua austerity. There is  a focus on making sure there are sustainable fiscal plans, but in  terms of short-term programs, the global community has embraced  the idea that we need to use all policy tools.  Now, if you look around the world, even in the last six months,  you've seen from China to Canada, from South Korea to Japan, more  use of fiscal tools in a responsible way. It doesn't mean build  up debt that's unsustainable. But it does mean don't try to hit  deficit targets and debt targets in the short term when you need  to get your economic engine moving.  I think fiscal authorities during this recession put more  pressure on monetary authorities than they should have. I've said  that all along. Here in the United States, we went too fast in  the terms of some of the fiscal consolidation. There was a big  debate in the United States in 2011 and 2012 about this. We've  done okay. We could have done better. We could have had a little  more growth if we had put some of the savings a few years out and  less of the savings in the front end. Other countries didn't do  as much as we did. They didn't have the recovery. They didn't do  a payroll tax. You know they didn't come back repeatedly and put  more fiscal power to deal with economies that needed it.  It wasn't always pretty in the United States, but we used all of  our policy tools. Our fed was aggressive, our fiscal program was  big, and our reform to the financial system was a structural  reform that we needed here in the United States.  There are still challenges in the future, but our call  internationally is for all the tools to be used.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to talk about the challenges in the future.  Could you give us an idea -- maybe you've thought about this.  What goes in the letter that you leave for your successor?  JACOB LEW: Well, this may surprise you, Steve, but that's  something you think about when you get to the last day, in my  experience. You don't write it four months in advance.  I think that we're still focused on the work we have to finish in  these next four months. I think that the economy that we are  working through now and that we will leave behind is much, much  stronger in almost every dimension than the economy we inherited.  I'm proud of that. That's something the American people are well  served by.  That doesn't mean that all of the challenges of the future are  addressed. I think these questions of income inequality are deep  economic and social issues. And we've put proposals forward that  we believe deal with that in a sensible way to pay for things  like education, starting with preschool, community college  education, and pay for infrastructure and to have an equitable  distribution of tax burden to pay for it. Those debates aren't  over.  I think that if we take a long break from dealing with all of  those issues, we pay a price. It starts to stress both the  economy and the social fabric.  I think we've done enormously important work. I don't think any  administration finishes the job. You pass the baton, and you give  some advice, and then you try from the sidelines to help move  things in the right direction.  STEVE LIESMAN: So I wonder if, four months in advance, you think  about what you'd do personally. Have you thought about going back  to Wall Street or academia? What have you thought about?  JACOB LEW: I have made one key decision: To live in the same city  as my wife for the next four years.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm looking forward to Lew the Musical. And thank  you very much for joining us.  JACOB LEW: Thanks, Steve.

We've had the privilege on five of -- this will be the fifth time  -- save one of our Delivering Alphas, each time we've had the  privilege of Treasury Secretary of the United States being with  us, back to Mr. Geithner's term and now, for the third time, the  76th Treasury Secretary of the United States, please welcome to  the stage, Jacob Lew and his interviewer, Steve Liesman, chief  economics correspondent for CNBC. Got to get the title right.  STEVE LIESMAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for continuing this  tradition of kicking off Delivering Alpha with us.  JACOB LEW: Great to be with you this morning.  STEVE LIESMAN: Am I right that you were just a little late  because you were meeting with the lyricist for the musical that's  going to be made with your tenureship? Is that right?  JACOB LEW: Just like every other New Yorker, I was stuck in  traffic.  STEVE LIESMAN: Will it be rap?  I want to start off with some of the headlines. I mean, it's been  a series of headlines from your brief, so to speak, over the last  several days.  This morning there's a story that an executive who oversaw some  of the places where there was alleged phony accounts created at  Wells Fargo made $125 million. Do you feel this is money that  should be clawed back or there should be systems in place to claw  this money back?  JACOB LEW: The consumer protection agency that took action  against Wells Fargo is an important new addition to our  protections for individuals and for the financial system. It  didn't exist before financial reform. I think they uncovered  practices that they have taken action against. I don't comment on  specific regulatory matters. But what I can tell you is what I've  seen from what they've done is bad behavior they were correct to  take action against. And how that flows through in terms of next  consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.  What I can tell you is there's a lot of talk in Washington these  days about rolling back Dodd-Frank, about rolling back the law,  changing the law that created the agency that uncovered and took  action against this. This ought to be a moment when people stop  and remember how dangerous the system is when you don't have the  proper protections in place.  This is something that our watchdogs found. If they were not  there, they would still be going on. This is a wake-up call. It  should remind all of us, and firms, that culture and compensation  make a difference. How you reward people, how you motivate  people, and what values you hold people to matter.  There's a public responsibility, and I think the CFCB took action  reflecting the public responsibility, and there's a private  responsibility. And we each have to do our part.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if culture and compensation make a difference,  then why wouldn't you support a clawback of this?  JACOB LEW: I'm not commenting one way or the other on the  clawback. I really am not going to comment on the facts of the  specific case. It's being reviewed by an independent regulator.  It wouldn't be appropriate for me to speculate on something that  I don't know all the facts of. I think I'm addressing the issue  in a pretty conclusive way. This is unacceptable behavior. And  it's the kind of behavior that we need to be able to catch and  stop.  STEVE LIESMAN: We've had billions of dollars of fines levied on  financial institutions. And still this behavior is still being  uncovered. Is Justice going far enough here? Do we need to be in  a situation where, for example, companies are not allowed to  plead that they didn't commit the alleged act and that there are  individual indictments brought? We haven't seen that in any of  these financial crimes, or very few of them.  JACOB LEW: We have, I think, taken action on a pretty dramatic  basis to put fines, penalties in place for firms that have acted  badly. The question of whether or not to pursue criminal  prosecution is a decision that prosecutors ultimately make. We  have made clear we don't believe that anyone is too big to jail.  It's up to prosecutors to decide how you pursue the criminal  charges. It's not up to regulators or the policymakers.  What I can say is that the pattern of behavior that we've seen  here is something that needs to stop. It is not acceptable to do  things that are designed to increase either an individual or a  firm bottom line by deceiving consumers and passing along charges  that are either invisible or they don't know about.  And this is not the same as a financial crisis issue. This is  really a consumer protection issue. I don't think this is a  moment where we have to ask the kinds of questions that we did in  2008 about what it means about the underpinnings of the financial  system. But when I hear people say we want to roll back the  statute that created the consumer protection bureau, this is yet  another proof point that it was the right thing to create, it's  the right thing to have an independent director, and it's the  right thing to make sure that there's somebody, and an entity  watching over our system, to make sure that individuals get clear  information about their financial products and, when firms or  individuals behave badly, that somebody finds out about it and  takes action.  STEVE LIESMAN: Moving to another company story which is in the  headlines, and you're doing specifically with this issue of  Apple, an attempt by the European Union to get 14 1/2 billion  dollars of back taxes.  Beyond the company-specific story, is this an attempt by the E.U.  to essentially grab unpaid American taxes?  JACOB LEW: You know, Steve, I have an op-ed this morning in the  ""Wall Street Journal"" where I went into some length describing  our views on this. But let me briefly reprieve what I've said on  this. We have for some time told the European Commission that we  believe that this is an inappropriate approach. Why is it  inappropriate? We agree with them that it's wrong for companies  to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to get to zero or very  low tax rates by taking advantage of tax havens.  But the action that the European Commission took is out of the  framework of normal tax policy, a retroactive tax that reaches  into another country, another jurisdiction's tax base, in order  to make sure that a firm pays its taxes. We agree with them that  firms should pay their taxes. But when it's U.S. income, we think  that that tax should be paid in the United States.  We've done a lot of work over the last two years to work on an  international basis to make sure that -- to share information  better. And we have an ability to close several loopholes that  have contributed to the erosion of tax bases around the world. We  need to take action in the United States to decisively change and  pushing firms to take their income overseas. We have a broken  corporate tax code.  We have the highest statutory tax rate in the developed world.  It's riddled with deductions and loopholes that give advantages  that we don't really need or would design for for today's  economy. And the result is we see U.S. companies trying to impart  income in lower tax jurisdictions.  Now, those lower tax jurisdictions are for doing some things that  aren't right also. The race to the bottom with low tax rates to  be a magnet for those companies, that has to change too.  But what action do we need to take in the United States? We need  to fix our tax system. We need to close the loopholes. We need to  lower the statutory tax rate. And one of the things that we've  proposed, which I believe is an idea that will still have  resonance in the year to come is that the revenue that we get by  putting a one-time tax on income that's parked overseas will  produce one-time revenue that ought to be used to fund an  investment in infrastructure in this country.  So we can do two things at the same time. We can fix a broken tax  code. We can make it so that our companies don't feel they have  to leave the United States to put their income overseas. And we  can fix our broken infrastructure.  What I don't think is right is for tax authorities and other  jurisdictions to reach into our tax base and to remove the  ability for us to execute what I just described.  STEVE LIESMAN: So if they're reaching in on Apple, are there  other company cases yet to come?  JACOB LEW: There are a number of pending matters --  STEVE LIESMAN: Pending, but what about ones that you think  there's going to be more of a grab at this point?  JACOB LEW: I can't speak to the European Commission, but we have  spoken on the policy. We don't address individual cases. As I  mentioned before, I'm not addressing the individual case that  they choose to act on.  STEVE LIESMAN: So does that mean you won't join as a party to the  case in Europe, to join as an amicus, so to speak?  JACOB LEW: Well, the European procedure is a little bit different  than ours. They are very aware of our views. We've submitted our  views in a pretty formal way. The parties here are the government  involved and the company involved. They've both indicated their  intention to appeal. And we've made our views known to the  authorities in Europe. And we've done it in a way that our views  will be before the commission on future matters as well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the tax rate, the right corporate  tax rate. 35% is the current top rate, just the federal part.  There's another six points or so according to the OECD that would  be added on some level. You proposed 28. It seems like the House  Republicans wanted 25, and Donald Trump wants 15.  15 would be toward the lower end of the OECD. 12 1/2 is Ireland.  Germany is around 15. Why wouldn't we want a rate that low that  would make America very competitive?  JACOB LEW: The principle that's driven our work on tax reform is  that it has to be revenue neutral. We are -- I don't think -- it  would not be right for us to have individuals pay more taxes for  us to lower the corporate tax rate.  What we've proposed doing is eliminating loopholes and deductions  and using the revenues that we get by doing that to reduce the  tax rate on the business side as much as we can. We got to 28%  essentially because that was the amount of loopholes that we  could close.  STEVE LIESMAN: I get what you're saying, and that makes perfect  sense on one side of the ledger. But the other side of the  ledger, at 28, you're still not competitive and there's still a  13-point incentive for companies to go overseas.  JACOB LEW: In the 25-28% range, we're getting pretty close to the  average. And a few minutes ago, I talked about the race to the  bottom. Some of the pressures on countries that cut their tax  rates to low rates in order to be a magnet, if we, as we have  discussed in the G20 and the OECD and other international bodies,  truly believe that we need to close down the pathways to tax  avoidance, we're going to need to conform to some norms. And  having countries go to very low tax rates is part of the problem.  We have our problem. We have a very high rate and a broken  system. We need to fix our system and take a look at theirs as  well.  STEVE LIESMAN: Is this a failure of the administration for  corporate tax reform here?  JACOB LEW: I actually think that if you look at the history of  tax reform, it often takes many years for it to kind of take  hold. And it's not unusual for it to begin in one administration  and finish in another. I feel we've made actually a great deal of  progress working through bipartisan conversations to build a  growing consensus around the kind of approach that I've  described.  I think that there's an environment now where the political  environment is not one where it has been ripe to take up  something like this. But the ideas that we've been promoting will  be the foundation for action in the future.  So I actually feel we've moved significantly toward tax reform.  You know, it takes a desire on the part of Congress to do  something hard. Hard things don't happen unless there's a real,  real desire to do it. And you need a partner. We have had  individual partners, but, as a whole, we have not had that  commitment.  STEVE LIESMAN: But if you look at this issue from outside the  Beltway, one guy is at 28, the other guy is at 25. Let's get in  the room, spend 7 minutes, and we'll make a deal. It seems like  you were impossibly close almost the entire time and didn't make  it down there.  JACOB LEW: You and I have discussed this a number of times,  Steve.  STEVE LIESMAN: And I still don't have a good -- not from you, but  in general.  JACOB LEW: I do believe that the people that we've engaged with,  who have been leaders on the Republican side, now Speaker Paul  Ryan, some senators who have been engaged in it, we've had a lot  of conversations that lead me to believe there is the basis for  an agreement. I just think the time for that agreement is  probably not the next four months.  STEVE LIESMAN: Do you look back --  JACOB LEW: In terms of need to do it, you look at the  infrastructure component of this, I think there's an urgency  right now to dealing with infrastructure. You look at the action  taken by the European Commission, that's an urgency that we need  to act if we want to protect our tax base.  You have an alignment of forces right now that I think create a  real opportunity. And I certainly think that's an opportunity the  American people would be well served if Congress takes advantage  of.  STEVE LIESMAN: Let's talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Again, that's another program or effort by the administration,  worked hard on it, seemed to get agreement, and now can't get it  through Congress. Do you regret that? Is that a failure of the  administration?  JACOB LEW: Well, first, I wouldn't draw conclusions about what we  can and can't get through.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm watching my clock here.  JACOB LEW: There's still time for the TPP, Trans-Pacific  Partnership, to be approved.  Let's start with the substance. TPP is a good economic deal for  the United States. It's good for American workers. And it's good  for U.S. security interests in the world. It means that they will  have a more level playing field. American products and services,  which are best in the world, will be able to compete on stronger  ground. And it retains the U.S. leadership in the world on  important strategic issues.  So I think it's vitally important that we get it approved. I  believe there's still support for TPP. There's clearly opponents  of TPP. I can't question that. We've passed through the Congress,  about a year ago, the underlying legislation, Trade Promotion  Authority, which provides the procedural basis to approve TPP.  TPA, I believe, was a harder vote than TPP. It was an  abstraction; it wasn't a specific agreement.  I can point in TPP to how it strengthens labor standards, how it  strengthens environmental standards, how it raises business  practices closer to our own. I can point around the world to  countries that are already taking policy actions, whether it's  Mexico or Vietnam, to meet some of those standards.  I think we have the substance profoundly on our side. What I  think the challenge we have -- and this is a big challenge. We  can make the case that it will improve growth in the United  States, and more GDP should be good for everyone. Where we're  running into a problem right now is the sense that is not just in  the United States, but it's in other parts of the world, that  more growth does not necessarily mean better wages or better  opportunity for working people.  I think the issue that is the real issue that we're going to have  to deal with is to show how the benefit gets to individuals. And  that's bigger than TPP. I think we saw that in the United Kingdom  in the vote recently on the referendum.  STEVE LIESMAN: And that's a failure at every level of leadership,  when it comes to economic issues, the issue of trade and its  benefits. The support of the American people has eroded almost  across the board.  JACOB LEW: Right. But the point I just made, Steve, is it's  broader than trade. I think it gets to the question of a social  compact. I think it gets to the question of how free market  capitalism and liberal democracy thrives. We have to ask some  serious questions about what is it that's holding wages back?  What is it that's preventing individuals from feeling that they  have a share in growth?  I know what we can do at a public policy level. At a public  policy level, talking about infrastructure, and we talk about  skills. If you want to have working people feel that they have a  stake in the future, they have to have the skills to get jobs in  the economy of the future, and they have to have the ability to  get to and from home and work. And they have to see a growing  economy that's going to grow the kinds of jobs that they can take  advantage of. That's bigger than trade.  I think we have a confluence of things that have been going on  between technology and trade and the changing structure of our  economy that are making it a challenging moment. But TPP on its  face should be a clear plus. And we're going to continue to make  that case. And I think we're going to have to demonstrate the  commitment to working families.  STEVE LIESMAN: But, I mean, in that equation, you have to address  the omnibus criticism of the Obama administration, which was one  of regulation that tamped down on private enterprise, and too  much government intrusion into the private sector that really  kept some of the gains getting to individuals.  JACOB LEW: I think if you look at where the economy was when we  took office just under eight years ago, it was in the middle of  the greatest recession since the Great Depression. We were seeing  unemployment at 10%. There was no bottom. We put in place an  economic program that's lifted the United States out of that  recession. We've seen sustained growth. We've seen 15 million new  jobs. We're seeing wage growth. And some of these things that  you're just labeling regulation are also why we're able to be in  a place to meet our commitments to reduce our emissions and to  meet the standards to make this a safer world by having our  climate problems not engulf our future.  There's a lot of things going on inside the package that you call  just more regulation. This economy is a stronger economy because  of the policies we've pursued. It's not as strong an economy as  we would like to see. A lot of what I see as having held back the  U.S. economy is the headwinds internationally. We've seen  probably a half a percentage point of GDP shaved off the U.S.  economy because demand globally has been weak.  That's one of the reasons we put so much time into trying to help  move the global debate towards using more policy tools to grow  demand and grow the economy. And we've made progress there. I  think we've made real progress. You are seeing a number of  countries around the world put in place more aggressive policy  using fiscal tools as well as monetary tools.  So I think there's a lot of things going on. And I think right  now the United States is looked to in the world as being a  resilient economy that's bounced back. What I tell my colleagues  around the world is we can't be the only engine in the world  economy. There need to be multiple engines.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to get to the overall economy. But one of  the things you've talked about is this need to invest in  infrastructure. The Republican nominee has accomplished something  like half a trillion dollars for spending on infrastructure. Do  you think that's a good number?  JACOB LEW: I have to tell you, Steve, I haven't dissected any of  the campaign proposals. I'm not doing politics in my current  life. I'm happy to talk about our policies, but I haven't  actually taken apart the campaign proposals.  STEVE LIESMAN: Well, what's the right number for infrastructure  investment? I assume you're talking over a 10-year period.  JACOB LEW: Yeah, the right number is a very, very big one. We  have trillions of dollars that need to be invested. It's not all  public money. What we did a year ago, a little over a year ago,  is we extended our surface transportation funding for five years,  basically at level funding, a little bit of an increase. Enough  to maintain what we're doing now, not enough to build the new  facilities that we need to compete in the 21st century.  I think putting several hundred billion dollars of federal money  into a commitment on a multiyear basis to build infrastructure  would have an effect on state and local planning that would bring  more state and local resources to bear and, just as importantly,  would be a foundation for public-private partnerships, which is  what gives you the ability to leverage the amount of resource you  are putting in.  This is not all a question of just federal funding. But federal  funding has been the foundation. One of the things that we do is  we create a kind of certainty out there that there's steady flow  to get projects off the drawing board. Without that, the whole  system slows down. And I think we have taken some time off from  driving that process forward, not to the point that it's  irreparable, but we can't take another decade off.  STEVE LIESMAN: At the same time, when we look at overall economic  growth, we're doing just around 1% the last three quarters. How  much concern has this caused you that we can't even get to the  new lower new normal of 2%?  JACOB LEW: I think when you go quarter to quarter, sometimes you  can overexplain an individual quarter.  We've seen growth in the low 2% for a number of years now. We're  continuing to see strong labor markets. We're continuing to see  improvements in wage growth. Consumers in the U.S. are very  strong. Housing is doing better. Autos have been doing very well.  The weak spot on the economic picture is investment. And I think  that if we could figure out what it is that's going on in  investment and productivity to drive the investment numbers  forward, that would be very important. I mean, I think that there  is a lingering lack of confidence in the global economy coming  out of the economic crisis. It was a deep, deep economic crisis.  It left concern. How do you know we're not snapping back?  I think in the United States we've demonstrated pretty decisively  that we're not slipping back. There are other parts of the world  where every three to six months you wonder, is it going one way  or the other? There's a lot of geopolitical risks. I think we  have to stabilize those risks.  One of the things we do when we meet in the G20 is focus on that.  And just last week we met in China at the G20 leaders meeting.  And I think you heard a few things at that meeting that were  important and different.  One is what I just talked about in terms of inclusive growth, in  terms of everybody sharing in it. We used to be a chorus of maybe  one talking about inclusive growth. All the leaders were talking  about inclusive growth. I think there's a clear understanding  that we have to show that the benefits of growth get to working  people globally right now.  Secondly, there was a commitment to using all policy tools that  is much stronger than its been in the past, where heads of state  are talking about using the fiscal space they have more  vigorously. And I think on the exchange rate issues that have  been so vexing for a long time, we have a clear agreement to  refrain from competitive devaluation and to coordinate together  so that, at moments of volatility, we don't see unilateral  actions that destabilize the global economy.  STEVE LIESMAN: I just want to come back to one of the things you  just talked about, which is using the fiscal side.  Is the fiscal side getting a message from the monetary side that  there's only so far they're willing to go? Mario Draghi last week  suggested, you know, we're at a negative place. We don't want to  go more negative. Possibility of the feds discussing raising  interest rates. Is the fiscal side getting a new message from the  monetary side?  JACOB LEW: As you know, Steve, I don't comment on monetary  policy, particularly not fed policy.  STEVE LIESMAN: We're talking about fiscal policy.  JACOB LEW: I don't think that fiscal authorities needed messages  from anyone that the fiscal tools are important. We've been  delivering that message consistently since 2009. I've been doing  it as treasury secretary for the last three and a half years.  What we've seen over the last three years is a shift in the  debate.  When I became treasury secretary, there was a global debate about  austerity versus growth. We went to G7 and G20 meetings and there  would be debates about austerity versus growth. Those debates are  over. There is no more focus on austerity qua austerity. There is  a focus on making sure there are sustainable fiscal plans, but in  terms of short-term programs, the global community has embraced  the idea that we need to use all policy tools.  Now, if you look around the world, even in the last six months,  you've seen from China to Canada, from South Korea to Japan, more  use of fiscal tools in a responsible way. It doesn't mean build  up debt that's unsustainable. But it does mean don't try to hit  deficit targets and debt targets in the short term when you need  to get your economic engine moving.  I think fiscal authorities during this recession put more  pressure on monetary authorities than they should have. I've said  that all along. Here in the United States, we went too fast in  the terms of some of the fiscal consolidation. There was a big  debate in the United States in 2011 and 2012 about this. We've  done okay. We could have done better. We could have had a little  more growth if we had put some of the savings a few years out and  less of the savings in the front end. Other countries didn't do  as much as we did. They didn't have the recovery. They didn't do  a payroll tax. You know they didn't come back repeatedly and put  more fiscal power to deal with economies that needed it.  It wasn't always pretty in the United States, but we used all of  our policy tools. Our fed was aggressive, our fiscal program was  big, and our reform to the financial system was a structural  reform that we needed here in the United States.  There are still challenges in the future, but our call  internationally is for all the tools to be used.  STEVE LIESMAN: I want to talk about the challenges in the future.  Could you give us an idea -- maybe you've thought about this.  What goes in the letter that you leave for your successor?  JACOB LEW: Well, this may surprise you, Steve, but that's  something you think about when you get to the last day, in my  experience. You don't write it four months in advance.  I think that we're still focused on the work we have to finish in  these next four months. I think that the economy that we are  working through now and that we will leave behind is much, much  stronger in almost every dimension than the economy we inherited.  I'm proud of that. That's something the American people are well  served by.  That doesn't mean that all of the challenges of the future are  addressed. I think these questions of income inequality are deep  economic and social issues. And we've put proposals forward that  we believe deal with that in a sensible way to pay for things  like education, starting with preschool, community college  education, and pay for infrastructure and to have an equitable  distribution of tax burden to pay for it. Those debates aren't  over.  I think that if we take a long break from dealing with all of  those issues, we pay a price. It starts to stress both the  economy and the social fabric.  I think we've done enormously important work. I don't think any  administration finishes the job. You pass the baton, and you give  some advice, and then you try from the sidelines to help move  things in the right direction.  STEVE LIESMAN: So I wonder if, four months in advance, you think  about what you'd do personally. Have you thought about going back  to Wall Street or academia? What have you thought about?  JACOB LEW: I have made one key decision: To live in the same city  as my wife for the next four years.  STEVE LIESMAN: I'm looking forward to Lew the Musical. And thank  you very much for joining us.  JACOB LEW: Thanks, Steve.

539,"Lower Output, Higher Costs Hit Statoil Operating Profit",2007-10-29T12:54:58+0000,,"Norway's StatoilHydro said currency gains boosted its third-quarter net profit, but lower oil and gas output and higher costs hit operating results and made the $110 billion group cautious on 2007 production targets.Output fell 2 percent year-on-year to just over 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, a touch below forecasts and echoing industry trends seen at both Shell and BP, where production fell 4 percent.Shares in StatoilHydro rose 1.6 percent to 185.7 crowns after a slow start to outpace the DJ Stoxx Oil and Gas Index, up 1.2 percent on the back of record oil prices.Earnings before interest and tax fell to 24.4 billion crowns ($4.54 billion) in July-September from 30.2 billion a year ago, worse than all forecasts by 18 analysts in a Reuters poll, which ranged from 24.8 billion to 30.3 billion crowns.""The decrease is mainly caused by lower downstream results, a 15 percent decrease in gas prices, as well as higher operational costs and exploration activity,"" Chief Executive Helge Lund told a news conference on Monday.Net profit rose 26 percent to 10.7 billion crowns, beating an average forecast of 9.9 billion in the Reuters survey, ""mainly due to an increase in net financial items from currency gains,"" StatoilHydro said.The third-quarter results are the last without the oil and gas assets of industrial group Norsk Hydro, which Statoil officially took over on Oct. 1 to become StatoilHydro.""The numbers were worse than expected, and adjusted for one-off effects, they were even worse,"" said analyst Martin Moelsaeter at First Securities.Foggy GuidanceLund said he expected Statoil's production to be at the lower end of its 2007 target of 1.15-1.2 million boed, but offered little vision for beyond this year.The group will give figures including output from the acquired Norsk Hydro assets on Nov. 12, and its production targets for 2008 are due out early next year.Mark Bloomfield, analyst at Citigroup Global Markets, said StatoilHydro did not have a ""confidence-building quarter"" in terms of production, but he expected combined StatoilHydro production to grow by 8 percent in 2008.""(StatoilHydro's investment) story may be hurt by near-term uncertainty over volume guidance, but this is presently outweighed by $90 a barrel plus oil price,"" Bloomfield said.""StatoilHydro remains our top pick (in Europe's integrated oil and gas segment), reflecting attractive fundamental valuation and a 10 percent ... discount to the peer group.""StatoilHydro's oil and gas production in the third quarter fell to 1.056 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, below the 1.08 million boed average forecast. Its production costs per barrel rose to 31.3 crowns for the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from 26.2 crowns for all of 2006.Russian HopesLast week StatoilHydro agreed with Russia's Gazprom to become a partner in the giant Shtokman gas field in the Russian part of the Barents Sea.Lund said costs stemming from the deal will come later.

""The story is premature. We are still having discussions with  Greece.

According to reports, the gap has emerged because euro zone  central banks have refused to roll over Greek debt that they hold  - refusing to buy new bonds when older bonds mature. Reuters  reported Wednesday that foot-dragging could leave Greece some 2  billion euros ($2.7 billion) short this year.  ""The central banks will make their own decisions.

Jay Bray, Mr. Cooper's CEO, helped federal regulators set up the plan. He said he was told there would be federal cash for servicers, but that part of the deal never made it to the final act.""It's frankly frustrating and ridiculous that we do not have a solution in place,"" said Bray. ""There is going to be complete chaos. We're the largest nonbank. We have a strong balance sheet, but for the industry as a whole you're going to start seeing problems soon.""In an interview Wednesday on CNBC, Mark Calabria, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said he estimated about 2 million borrowers would seek forbearance by May. He did not agree that servicers need liquidity now, only later.""If this goes beyond two or three months, and we start to get worse than that, then that's going to be a lot of strain, and certainly we're going to start to see some firms get into a lot of liquidity trouble,"" Calabria said.Others, however, have much higher estimates for the forbearance program. Laurie Goodman, co-director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at Urban Institute, predicted a worst-case scenario of nearly 12 million borrowers receiving some kind of forbearance at a cost of $66 billion for six months. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, predicted about 15 million households would receive some forbearance on their home loans.""We had a tremendous surge in April, you're going to see another massive surge in the middle of the month when they [borrowers] are considered late, and another massive surge in May,"" said Bray. ""They're going to need these forbearance plans, and it's going to continue to grow at a pace that, frankly, some people don't understand and are dismissing how big a problem it's going to be.""Even as Americans begin to receive checks from the government, there is no guarantee they will use that money to pay their mortgages. The forbearance program forbids servicers from asking for any proof of hardship. Bray said that was the right course.""I do not believe it is a moral hazard. It's not a payment forgiveness plan. Let's say it's three month, at the end of that time they can repay, go onto partial payment, or go into some type of modification, and then there will be some kind of documentation required,"" said Bray. But others disagree.""Throwing this out there without showing evidence of hardship was an outrageous move, outrageous,"" said David Stevens, who headed the Federal Housing Administration during the subprime mortgage crisis and is a former CEO of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ""The administration made a huge mistake bringing moral hazard in and thrust extraordinary risk into the private sector that could collapse the mortgage market.""Stevens said borrowers should have been required to show at least some proof of hardship, which they had to do during subprime mortgage bailout. Moral hazard aside, he, too, contended a liquidity facility for servicers is essential.""This is a crisis so easily correctable,"" he said. ""The GSEs [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] for years have always assured the servicing community that in the event of a major credit event, they'll be there to make sure they provide the liquidity. From what we are hearing, and we can't verify it, the FHFA director instructed the GSEs not to set up a liquidity or advance facility.""When asked for a response to the industry plea, Calabria on Monday declined to comment.Both Stevens and Bray said that because of this new and momentous risk in the mortgage market, it is suddenly much harder for borrowers to get new loans or refinance current mortgages. Wells Fargo is already placing restrictions on jumbo lending to its customers.""It's just going to create more fear within the nonbank servicing sector. The banks that service them are going to start to not lend,"" said Bray. ""Ultimately that impacts homeowners. They won't be able to be served because these companies will be in the middle of a crisis. We've seen a lot of businesses close their doors, and if you start closing the doors of servicers you're impacting people's lives much more than other sectors. You're talking about their homes. It's the largest asset they have.""",12:37.3

One application for German exports was filed in January and is  awaiting a decision by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS),  which is responsible for reviewing requests to export crude under  a 1975 law that bans most shipments with a few exceptions,  including sales to Canada and re-export of foreign oil.  (Read more: )These are the first permits for shipments to Britain since at  least 2000 and the first to any European country since 2008,  according to data from the BIS. The bureau has approved 120  licenses since January 2013, nearly 90 percent of which were for  sales to Canada, the data show.  It was not immediately clear under which provisions BIS granted  the European export licenses. The current regulation allows  foreign crude to be re-exported from the United States if it is  not commingled with U.S. crude, an option that some Canadian  producers are said to be using.  In rare cases, the regulation permits the exchange of U.S. oil  for foreign crude or refined products of higher value, which has  become an attractive option with the growing surplus of light,  sweet shale oil.  Whatever the case, the licenses could add to the growing debate  in Washington on the benefits and pitfalls of lifting the ban,  among the year's most urgent energy policy questions, as the  relentless rise in shale oil production threatens to saturate  domestic refiners as soon as this year.  They may add to expectations that the Obama administration will  allow companies to use provisions in the existing regulation to  slowly increase exports, while stalling on a decision on whether  to scrap the ban.  With U.S. oil production at a 25-year high, many oil producers  are eyeing other markets and have called for an end to the ban on  exports, which they consider a relic of the 1970s, when the Arab  oil embargo led to steep prices at the pump.  Alaskan Republican Lisa Murkowski, the Senate Energy and Natural  Resource Committee's top Republican, has backed that position.  (Read more: All 50  states have gas prices above $3 per gallon)  On the other side, independent U.S. refiners, which stand to  benefit from cheaper domestic crude, have argued against easing  restrictions.  Sen. Ron Wyden, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee and an Oregon Democrat, warned at a hearing last week  that ""a number of influential voices"" that want to export oil  could drown out the risks for the average consumer.  If more exports to Europe are allowed, refiners across the  Atlantic may have cause to celebrate since access to cheap,  high-quality U.S. shale oil would help revive their margins.  The BIS did not respond to frequent requests for information on  the nature of the licenses. It declined to comment on the  identity of the exporting companies, citing exceptions in the  Export Administration Act.  The bureau's data do not show which permits were used, and the  Energy Department's oil export data do not show any crude  shipments to Europe through November 2013. European exports a rarity  Exports of crude to Canada were initially approved by President  Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, and have picked up rapidly in recent  years. The United States sent about 200,000 barrels of oil a day  to Canada in November, the highest volume since 1999, data from  the Department of Energy shows.  A handful of licenses have also been regularly approved over the  past decade for countries in Central America or Asia, either for  the export of heavy California crude or the re-export of  foreign-origin oil, according to a BIS statement released last  year.  (Read more: Keystone XL  oil pipeline clears significant hurdle)  But European countries have rarely appeared on the list. Two  permit applications filed in 2011 for exports to Switzerland and  one for exports to the Netherlands were not approved.  The two approved U.K. permits were for shipments with a total  maximum value of $1.8 billion, while those to Italy were valued  at $3.12 billion. The application for German exports was worth  $2.6 billion, the data show.  Theodore Kassinger, a partner with the law firm O'Melveny and  Myers in Washington who previously served as the deputy secretary  and general counsel of the Department of Commerce, said the  bureau likely stuck to existing provisions to allow exports to  Europe.  ""The licenses were likely within the confines of the current law  and so they may have involved re-exports of foreign-origin oil,""  he said.  Without established trade routes or tanker rates, it is difficult  to compare the economics of exporting Canadian heavy oil sands  versus shipments of U.S. light-sweet oil to Europe. Few traders  have examined the value of such unprecedented shipments.  While Canadian crude trades at deep discounts to the U.S.  benchmark futures contract, most European refiners are not  configured to process the heavy oil.  Ultra light, low-sulfur Bakken, on the other hand, would be  welcome in Europe, but trades at relatively higher prices in the  United States where local refiners are still eager to replace  imported crude with the domestic grade. Export expansion suggests oil swaps   Others said oil volume swaps—whereby companies can export  U.S. light oil for a higher quality or volume of crude or refined  fuels—may be behind the recent expansion in export licenses  to Europe.  ""The implication is that we are not exchanging a higher value  item for a lower value,"" said Ed Morse, global head of commodity  research at Citi, while noting that re-exports of Canadian heavy  oil from U.S. shores are on the rise.  Applicants for such licenses have to demonstrate that the trade  is part of an overall transaction in the nation's interest and  the oil cannot be sold for a reasonable price in the United  States.  Sellers also have to prove that exports will be terminated if  U.S. supplies are seriously threatened.  ""I am skeptical that it was a swap because tests for such exports  are very complicated,"" Kassinger said, referring to sellers' onus  to prove that they can't sell the oil at a profit within the  country.  ""But the time will not be very far when it will not be  commercially viable to market the crude in the country,"" he said. —By Reuters",12:37.6

The bank kept rates unchanged on Thursday and promised to keep its massive stimulus program. The bank also revised its inflation forecasts upwards. It sees headline inflation at 1.6 percent at the end of 2018 compared to the 1.5 percent projected last December. In terms of growth, the bank has also revised its forecasts upwards for this year from 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent. However, it called on all euro area countries to step up reforms to ensure stable growth. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi declared the euro ""irrevocable"" at Thursday's press conference ahead of key elections this summer. As a consequence, German 10-year bond yields spiked to hit a one-month high of 0.43 percent and the euro hit session high of $1.0605.In corporate news, the Danish firm Novo Nordisk has begun talks with Global Blood Therapeutics, a U.S. company, for a potential acquisition, Reuters reported.

The  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter will be stealthier, smarter, more  capable, and more flexible than any aircraft ever built.   It better be. It's costing American taxpayers close to $1  billion. A month.""It is a flying computer,"" said Steve O'Bryan, vice president of the  F-35's integration and business development at Lockheed Martin.  ""Where technology goes, where software goes, the F-35 will be  flexible with it.""  That's important for an aircraft which the U.S. military and its  allies are counting on to be the backbone of air defenses for the  next half-century. Read MoreThis is what caused the LA air traffic system crashFor example, the F-35 currently isn't  configured to control another aircraft, such as an unmanned plane  that may fly in formation with it, since no UAV—unmanned aerial vehicle—has yet been created that can keep pace with the F-35. That will probably change over the next  quarter century, and, conceivably, the software could be easily  added. ""The future would bring you an F-35 operating UAVs,"" said  O'Bryan.  A lot is riding on the Joint Strike Fighter's success. A  hundred jets have been built so far, and they are being tested by  the military. The first combat-ready airplane is slated to be  delivered next year. Eventually there will be more than 2,400  flying for the U.S. military, with allies buying hundreds  more. However, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office  found that issues remain with some of the jet's software, a problem that could again delay the rollout of an aircraft  that has already dealt with an array of problems and seen its  original price tag double. Developing, buying, and maintaining  the F-35 program over the next half century will cost about $1  trillion, with a ""T.""Still, the military remains committed to the plane. ""They're still working on the software,"" said Lt. Col. Matt  Renbarger, who is test-flying the aircraft at Eglin Air Force  Base in Florida. ""Apple and IBM, when they build new computers,  have to work through software things when they start things up—we're working through the same issues on our end, too,"" he said.  ""I'm confident the entire team is going to be able to put  together a very good airplane.""   There are many firsts with the F-35. It will be the first fighter  jet made of composite material. It consolidates a seemingly  endless amount of information onto a couple of screens inside the  cockpit...or onto the pilot's visor inside a custom-fitted  helmet. In addition, external cameras around the jet can transmit  pictures onto the visor so that when a pilot looks down, it will  be as if he or she is looking right through the bottom of the  plane.Read MoreThe city that may be Ukraine's line in the sand""If the radar sees something, the electronic warfare  system sees something, your wingman sees something in his  airplane, all of that stuff gets poured in, and you look on your  display, and you just have one picture of the battlespace,"" said  former F-35 test pilot Art Tomassetti, who now helps manage the  program at Lockheed.   That's a lot of information for one pilot to process, and as much  as the aircraft of the future is changing, so are the skills  needed in pilots.   ""The stick and rudder skills that used to be so important, we've  minimized, because we've made the airplane easy to fly,"" said  Tomassetti. ""What if we could teach anybody to fly the airplane?  Think about the spectrum (of pilots) that might open up for us.""  The best pilots in 25 years, he said, will be the best  tacticians.  ""We've trained 50 pilots here over the last year, and everyone  has said it's the easiest airplane they've ever flown,"" said Lt.  Col. Renbarger, who used to fly F-16s. Read MoreWith so much data  streaming in from so many sources, what's the risk of information overload?  ""We did have some concerns about that when we first started  flying the jet, but once we got into it and saw how much human  factors engineering had been put into the airplane, those  concerns have been allayed."" He added, ""All I have to worry about  is putting the cursors on something I want to shoot a missile at  or drop a bomb on...and it works.""Perhaps that's why the biggest threat to the best jet fighter  ever conceived isn't a Chinese warplane or a Russian missile—the  biggest threat could be far more potent: the budget ax. The  Pentagon is insisting Lockheed bring down the F-35's costs. and  there has been some progress on that front. For example, all three variations  of the jet are being built along the same assembly line in Ft.  Worth, which saves money. Read More""We also shrink the amount of time it  takes to build an F-35,"" said Steve O'Bryan. ""We only use about  15 percent of the labor force it took to build that same number  of F-16s.""   The F-35 has also created another trend we may see more of in 25  years: Bringing in international partners from the beginning to  help share the costs. Ten countries have invested in and/or  plan to buy the fighter.   Other trends include the ability of planes like the F-35 to carry  more bombs, but smaller, lighter bombs, which allow planes to fly  further and hit more targets. The entire military is also pushing  defense companies to build products that can operate on a single  software platform.   O'Bryan said the air defense system of the future will include  fewer single-mission aircraft—planes that really only have  one job—in favor of aircraft with multiple roles. ""Ninety  percent of every aircraft's lifetime is peacetime, and it also  has to contribute in that time as well, whether it be  intelligence-gathering or surveillance.""   It's a big shift from when he started flying F-18s a quarter  century ago.  Read More  ""When I flew, it was 'speed is life,'"" said O'Bryan. ""In today's  fifth generation (aircraft), it's 'information is life.'""   He said the old days of aerial dogfighting are over. If an F-35  pilot is ever actually seen by an enemy, he or she has done  something wrong. There's no need to ever get that close.   ""It's probably less romantic,"" O'Bryan said, ""but I never met a  fighter pilot who wanted a fair fight.""

566,"Fed's Evans sees fiscal boost to US growth, wants slow rate hikes",2017-02-03T14:17:29+0000,,"The U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates slowly even as fiscal policies under President Donald Trump are likely to help push economic growth beyond sustainable levels, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Friday.""Appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks,"" Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery at Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago. ""I favor taking a gradual path for the adjustment of the funds rate back toward its long-run level.""The Fed in December raised rates for only the second time since the financial crisis, and this week held them steady to give labor markets and inflation a chance to strengthen further.Most Fed officials see three rate hikes this year, a pace considerably faster than in 2016 and 2015 but much slower than in past rate-hike cycles. Evans, who votes this year on Fed policy, did not specify a preferred number of rate hikes for this year in his prepared remarks, though a few weeks ago said three is not ""implausible.""Evans said he expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent to 2.5 percent annual pace for the next couple of years, faster than its long-run sustainable pace of about 1.75 percent.

And that will help push inflation, now at about 1.7 percent, back up towards the Fed's 2 percent goal by 2019.Some analysts have speculated that the expansionary fiscal policies Trump has promised would light such a fire under an economy essentially already at full employment that the Fed would have no choice but to hike rates faster to brake growth.Evans on Friday did not seem too concerned about such a prospect. He warned, as he has before, that if the economy is pushed to grow at 4 percent for more than a couple years without structural reforms that boost productivity and labor force growth, inflationary pressures would build and would ultimately force the Fed to tighten financial conditions.But he also said his estimates are for a much more moderate fiscal boost, though he added it is early in the legislative process and ""there certainly is a possibility of larger temporary stimulus, as well as some policies that might influence longer-run growth.""A government report early Friday showing U.S. employers added more jobs than expected last month was ""very good"" news, Evans said.The unemployment rate moved up to 4.8 percent from 4.7 percent, but that was likely because of more people entering the workforce, a good sign for labor market health, Evans said at an event to benefit Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago.","cnbc, Articles, Donald Trump, Bitcoin, Economy, Federal Reserve System, The Fed, US Economy, US: News, Business News, source:tagname:Reuters","The U.S. Federal Reserve should raise interest rates slowly even as fiscal policies under President Donald Trump are likely to help push economic growth beyond sustainable levels, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Friday.""Appropriate policy calls for a slow pace of normalization in order to give the real economy an adequate growth buffer to withstand downside shocks,"" Evans said in remarks prepared for delivery at Prairie State College in Olympia Fields, south of Chicago.

570,ECB Eyes September for Bank Stress Tests,2013-01-24T06:43:16+0000,,"The European  Central Bank (ECB) and European Banking Authority (EBA) are aiming to carry out a joint  stress test on Europe's major banks in September, sources told Reuters. Austria's FMA markets watchdog said on Wednesday  that the EBA plans stress tests this year even as the European Central Bank prepares to  take on supervision of top lenders from 2014. Sources told Reuters that the ECB, which was  involved in the background of the last round of EBA stress tests, was set to take a more  central role before it assumes supervisory powers over the euro zone's banks. ""The preference is to have the EBA and ECB run   together, rather than have the reputational damage of having two (different)  ones,"" said a central bank source. The tests are ""likely to be in September"", he  added. Other sources said they also expected the tests in September, though the date has not yet  been finalized. The EBA's predecessor the Committee of European  Banking Supervisors (CEBS) started conducting stress tests on major lenders such as Deutsche  Bank, Santander and Unicredit in 2010. But the shortcomings of the probes were laid bare  when Ireland's banking system came close to collapse only four months after being given  a clean bill of health. ""As we said last year, we expect a new round of  stress tests in 2013 and discussions are on-going,"" an EBA spokeswoman said. ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said  last month that Europe wanted the ECB and the EBA to conduct coordinated stress  tests. EBA Chairman Andrea Enria has said that a key  addition to the next test willbe an examination of the quality of assets held by banks to  ensure they canabsorb losses properly in a crisis and leave taxpayers off the  hook. The discussions between the ECB and EBA partly  focus on working out how tomeasure the quality of banks' loans. ""There will be a stress test this year from the  EBA. That is the current status of the decision,"" Financial Markets Authority co-head  Helmut Ettl told a news conference on Wednesday, adding details were still under  discussion.

571,TEXT-S&P revises Crown Castle outlook to stable from positive,2012-10-02T18:17:00+0000,,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency)Overview-- U.S. tower operator Crown Castle has agreed to acquire rights to about7,200 T-Mobile USA towers for $2.4 billion in cash.-- We expect leverage to increase to nearly 8x at the end of 2012, proforma for the transaction, and decline modestly to the mid-7x area in 2013.-- We are revising our outlook on the company to stable from positivesince we no longer expect it to achieve leverage of 7x within our two-yearrating horizon.-- We are affirming all ratings on the company, including our 'B+'corporate credit rating;-- Issue and recovery ratings for Crown and its related entities remainunchanged at present, but will be re-evaluated when the company outlines adefinitive financing plan for the T-Mobile transaction.Rating ActionOn Oct. 2, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised its outlook onCrown Castle International Corp.to stable from positive as a result ofthe company's announced agreement to acquire rights to T-Mobile's 7,200 towersin a debt-financed transaction valued at about $2.4 billion. At the same time,we affirmed all of Crown's ratings, including the 'B+' corporate credit rating.RationaleThe outlook revision reflects our view that there is no longer a one-thirdprobability of an upgrade given the additional debt associated with theacquisition. We now expect leverage, including our adjustments for operatingleases, to be nearly 8x as of the end of 2012, pro forma for the EBITDAcontribution from the T-Mobile towers. While we believe that the combinationof contractual rent increases, additional tenant colocation revenues on itsexisting towers, and somewhat faster revenue growth on the T-Mobile towerswill contribute to a low- to mid-teen percent increase in EBITDA in 2013, wedon't expect leverage to drop to 7x or below before 2014 at the earliest. Ourpositive outlook had incorporated the possibility that Crown's leverage wouldimprove to 7x or less within our two-year rating horizon, which we no longerbelieve is achievable.The ratings on Crown reflect the company's aggressive financial policy, givenits historical use of debt and excess cash flow to fund large stockrepurchases. As a result, adjusted leverage is high, at about 7x for the 12months ended June 30, 2012. We anticipate that the company will benefit fromtower leasing revenue growth over the next year due to price increases in itscontracts and the addition of new tenants on its tower sites, which shouldcontribute to an increase in EBITDA in the mid- to high-single-digit area for2012 and 2013. The T-Mobile towers, which have a lower tenancy per tower thanCrown's own business, have somewhat higher growth potential, although ourassumption for the addition of tenants on these towers is fairly conservative.Moreover, given the company's aggressive financial policy, we believe it mayuse excess cash flow to repurchase stock rather than repay debt, especiallysince it has no near-term maturities.Crown is one of the largest independent tower operators in the U.S., with atotal portfolio of approximately 24,000 towers, in addition to variousdistributed antennae systems. Pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction, thecompany will operate a portfolio of over 30,000 towers.We view the business risk profile as ""strong.""The business generates cashflows with a high degree of stability, given the long-term nature of thewireless carrier contracts and high renewal rates. In addition, there has beena trend toward longer term contracts in this business and carriers have littleto no flexibility to terminate early without fully honoring the contract.Typical of the tower leasing industry, the high operating leverage of thebusiness also contributes to extremely healthy tower gross profit and overallunadjusted EBITDA margins, which were 74.6% and 62.6%, respectively, for thesecond quarter of 2012. A high percentage of the business' EBITDA cantranslate into discretionary free cash flow, given very modest maintenancecapital expenditures. However, we expect Crown to use a significant amount ofits discretionary cash flows to continue to repurchase its common stock.Crown benefits from continued subscriber growth in the wireless communicationsindustry, which has expanded both in terms of absolute subscribers andper-subscriber minutes of use. These trends and the need for more coverage andcapacity to accommodate demand have translated into additional tenants leasingspace on existing towers, a trend known as colocation. Moreover, the majorcarriers have upgraded their networks to provide higher speed wireless datacapabilities, which in many cases, has required additional tower equipment.The regional carriers also have increasingly added to their coverage areas tooffer plans competitive with the national players, which, in turn, haveboosted tower leasing revenues.Crown also benefits from stable monthly cash flows from carriers withsubstantial financial resources, including Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility.These long-term contracts have very high renewal rates and average annual rentincreases of 3%. Moreover, the towers have the capacity to support multipletenants, providing additional upside to cash flows per tower, particularlybecause adding tenants to existing towers involves minimal incrementaloperating expense.LiquidityWe consider Crown's liquidity ""adequate."" Sources of liquidity includeavailability of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility, coupled withthe expectation that the company will generate about $960 million of fundsfrom operations in 2012. We note that the company has not yet identified aspecific financing plan to fund the T-Mobile acquisition, although our""adequate"" liquidity assessment assumes it will be able to access the capitalmarkets for the transaction. We may revisit this assessment if the companydelays a financing plan or has difficulty in accessing the market.We expect that sources of liquidity will provide at least 1.2x coverage ofuses. We also expect Crown will continue to repurchase common stock, as wellas incur capital expenditures for land purchases, tower improvements, and newtower builds. The company is likely to maintain at least 15% minimum EBITDAcushion under its 6x total leverage covenant, which does not step down untilMarch 2014.Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, seethe recovery report on Crown, publishedAug. 2, 2012, on RatingsDirect.OutlookThe outlook is stable. As a result of Crown's acquisition of the leasingrights to the T-Mobile towers, we expect that its debt to EBITDA will benearly 8x for 2012, pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction. We expect thisleverage to decline to the mid-7x area by the end of 2013.The rating could be raised if we came to expect a leverage reduction to 7x orlower on a sustained basis, which could occur if EBITDA increases at around a13% rate in 2013 rather than the low- to mid-teen percent area we currentlyassume in our base-case scenario. Conversely, and less likely, in our view, wecould lower the rating if Crown were to become more aggressive in itsfinancial policy such that it used debt to repurchase stock for in excess of$5 billion, since this would increase leverage to the 10x area.Related Criteria And Research-- Business Risk/Financial Risk Matrix Expanded, Sept. 18, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies' Maturities Are Manageable, ButLower-Rated Issuers Face Some Liquidity Challenges, July 23, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies, Strongest To Weakest, July 13, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Ratings Should Be Stable Overall During WeakEconomic Recovery, July 13, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Telecom Companies Maintain High DividendPayouts, But For How Long?, May 30, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Cable And Satellite-TV Companies Ratchet UpShareholder Payouts, May 16, 2012-- Top 10 Investor Questions: U.S. Telecom and Cable Industries, May 10,2012-- Assessing The Four-Notch Rating Gap Between The Two U.S.Direct-To-Home Satellite Video Operators, May 9, 2012-- Liquidity Descriptors For Global Corporate Issuers, Sept. 28, 2011Ratings ListRatings Affirmed; Outlook ActionTo                 FromCrown Castle International Corp.Corporate Credit Rating                B+/Stable/--       B+/Positive/--Ratings Affirmed; Recovery Ratings UnchangedCrown Castle International Corp.Senior Unsecured                       B-Recovery Rating                      6CC Holdings GS V LLCCrown Castle GS III Corp.Senior Secured                         BBRecovery Rating                      1Crown Castle Operating Co.Senior Secured                         B+Recovery Rating                      4Complete ratings information is available to subscribers of RatingsDirect onthe Global Credit Portal at.

The T-Mobile towers, which have a lower tenancy per tower thanCrown's own business, have somewhat higher growth potential, although ourassumption for the addition of tenants on these towers is fairly conservative.Moreover, given the company's aggressive financial policy, we believe it mayuse excess cash flow to repurchase stock rather than repay debt, especiallysince it has no near-term maturities.Crown is one of the largest independent tower operators in the U.S., with atotal portfolio of approximately 24,000 towers, in addition to variousdistributed antennae systems. Pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction, thecompany will operate a portfolio of over 30,000 towers.We view the business risk profile as ""strong.""The business generates cashflows with a high degree of stability, given the long-term nature of thewireless carrier contracts and high renewal rates. In addition, there has beena trend toward longer term contracts in this business and carriers have littleto no flexibility to terminate early without fully honoring the contract.Typical of the tower leasing industry, the high operating leverage of thebusiness also contributes to extremely healthy tower gross profit and overallunadjusted EBITDA margins, which were 74.6% and 62.6%, respectively, for thesecond quarter of 2012. A high percentage of the business' EBITDA cantranslate into discretionary free cash flow, given very modest maintenancecapital expenditures. However, we expect Crown to use a significant amount ofits discretionary cash flows to continue to repurchase its common stock.Crown benefits from continued subscriber growth in the wireless communicationsindustry, which has expanded both in terms of absolute subscribers andper-subscriber minutes of use. These trends and the need for more coverage andcapacity to accommodate demand have translated into additional tenants leasingspace on existing towers, a trend known as colocation. Moreover, the majorcarriers have upgraded their networks to provide higher speed wireless datacapabilities, which in many cases, has required additional tower equipment.The regional carriers also have increasingly added to their coverage areas tooffer plans competitive with the national players, which, in turn, haveboosted tower leasing revenues.Crown also benefits from stable monthly cash flows from carriers withsubstantial financial resources, including Verizon Wireless and AT&T Mobility.These long-term contracts have very high renewal rates and average annual rentincreases of 3%. Moreover, the towers have the capacity to support multipletenants, providing additional upside to cash flows per tower, particularlybecause adding tenants to existing towers involves minimal incrementaloperating expense.LiquidityWe consider Crown's liquidity ""adequate."" Sources of liquidity includeavailability of $1 billion under the revolving credit facility, coupled withthe expectation that the company will generate about $960 million of fundsfrom operations in 2012. We note that the company has not yet identified aspecific financing plan to fund the T-Mobile acquisition, although our""adequate"" liquidity assessment assumes it will be able to access the capitalmarkets for the transaction. We may revisit this assessment if the companydelays a financing plan or has difficulty in accessing the market.We expect that sources of liquidity will provide at least 1.2x coverage ofuses. We also expect Crown will continue to repurchase common stock, as wellas incur capital expenditures for land purchases, tower improvements, and newtower builds. The company is likely to maintain at least 15% minimum EBITDAcushion under its 6x total leverage covenant, which does not step down untilMarch 2014.Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, seethe recovery report on Crown, publishedAug. 2, 2012, on RatingsDirect.OutlookThe outlook is stable. As a result of Crown's acquisition of the leasingrights to the T-Mobile towers, we expect that its debt to EBITDA will benearly 8x for 2012, pro forma for the T-Mobile transaction. We expect thisleverage to decline to the mid-7x area by the end of 2013.The rating could be raised if we came to expect a leverage reduction to 7x orlower on a sustained basis, which could occur if EBITDA increases at around a13% rate in 2013 rather than the low- to mid-teen percent area we currentlyassume in our base-case scenario. Conversely, and less likely, in our view, wecould lower the rating if Crown were to become more aggressive in itsfinancial policy such that it used debt to repurchase stock for in excess of$5 billion, since this would increase leverage to the 10x area.Related Criteria And Research-- Business Risk/Financial Risk Matrix Expanded, Sept. 18, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies' Maturities Are Manageable, ButLower-Rated Issuers Face Some Liquidity Challenges, July 23, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Companies, Strongest To Weakest, July 13, 2012-- U.S. Telecom And Cable Ratings Should Be Stable Overall During WeakEconomic Recovery, July 13, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Telecom Companies Maintain High DividendPayouts, But For How Long?, May 30, 2012-- A Matter of Policy: U.S. Cable And Satellite-TV Companies Ratchet UpShareholder Payouts, May 16, 2012-- Top 10 Investor Questions: U.S. Telecom and Cable Industries, May 10,2012-- Assessing The Four-Notch Rating Gap Between The Two U.S.Direct-To-Home Satellite Video Operators, May 9, 2012-- Liquidity Descriptors For Global Corporate Issuers, Sept. 28, 2011Ratings ListRatings Affirmed; Outlook ActionTo                 FromCrown Castle International Corp.Corporate Credit Rating                B+/Stable/--       B+/Positive/--Ratings Affirmed; Recovery Ratings UnchangedCrown Castle International Corp.Senior Unsecured                       B-Recovery Rating                      6CC Holdings GS V LLCCrown Castle GS III Corp.Senior Secured                         BBRecovery Rating                      1Crown Castle Operating Co.Senior Secured                         B+Recovery Rating                      4Complete ratings information is available to subscribers of RatingsDirect onthe Global Credit Portal at.

574,Bonds Regain Favor After Fannie & Freddie Takeover,2008-09-09T16:06:02+0000,,"While the impact of the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac bailout on stocks is less than certain, the rescue plan has created a new enthusiasm for bonds.","cnbc, Articles, Citigroup Inc, iShares Barclays Credit Bond Fund, General Electric Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc, Hatteras Financial Corp, Federal National Mortgage Association, Markets, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","While the impact of the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac bailout on stocks is less than certain, the rescue plan has created a new enthusiasm for bonds.In particular, mortgage-backed securities have regained favor with investors after the government seized the two mortgage giants, effectively taking over their $5 trillion in debt and pledging $200 billion in capital to cover expected losses.At the same time, investors are also preparing to step up buying of corporate bonds as well as Treasurys after the government intervention assuaged uncertainty about the security of the debt instruments.""I was a big buyer of (mortgage-backed) bonds until a couple months ago. I took a six- to nine-week vacation from buying just in case,"" says Dennis J. Barba, managing partner of the Oxford Group of Raymond James Associates in Cleveland. ""With what just happened we'll start purchasing those bonds again for our clients. I think it's a little safer to go in the water than it was a few weeks ago.""Barba is not alone in his enthusiasm for mortgage debt.The $4.5 trillion industry had what some analysts believed to be its biggest day Monday, the first trading day after the bailout announcement.Banks made about $20 billion selling the holdings as risk premiums over Treasurys fell by 40 basis points. The trade surged in part after two of the nation's leading bond traders, Pimco's Bill Gross and The Vanguard Group's Kenneth Volpert, said on CNBC that they would be buyers.""Stick with the partner that brought you to the dance,"" Gross said. ""Basically mortgage securities are attractive here because the Treasury announced that they were going to be buying them in the future. You want to buy them now and sell them back to the Treasury in the future at a higher price.""Watch video at left for analysis from Gross and Volpert.But Barba advises caution in the trade and said he is buying mostly short maturities and not going into the long end of the market, on the belief that there's more trouble ahead for mortgages that will send risk premiums higher.""What the Treasury announced doesn't end this mess,"" he says. ""It just takes a little bit of the gray out of the equation.""Mortgage-backed debt can be purchased through brokerages and comes mostly from Fannie and Freddie.Corporate Bonds Also AttractiveA newfound appetite for debt also is helping corporate bonds prosper.The average corporate bond yield of nearly 6 percent is an attractive enticement for investors amid a wobbly stock market, and some money managers have been parking their assets there until the equity storm and the credit crunch blow over. The bailout news helped sweeten the pot.""At this point we're still staying away from financial service corporate bonds, but we do like those of industrial companies and other industries that aren't really tied into the financial crisis at the moment,"" says Emily Sanders, president and CEO at Sanders Financial Management in Atlanta. Barba also likes corporate debt, and said he has bought short-term notes for his clients in companies including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, CNBC.com owner General Electric and Hartford Financial ServicesGroup.One obstacle to investing in such debt, though, is you generally need pretty deep pockets. Most corporate debt is bought in increments of $5,000 or $10,000, and the cost can get much higher for mortgage securities. The difficulty in making investments in smaller denominations comes in part because of the markup, or the price that a dealer charges compared to the actual price of the bond. High markups for corporate debt make the investment profitable only in considerable volume.To make the trade, Sanders says smaller investors can buy exchange-traded funds that don't have all the cost, risks and restrictions of the various debt types but track their movements.One such ETF is the iShares Lehman Credit Bond fund that reflects the U.S. investment-grade credit sector of the bond market as defined by the Lehman Brothers U.S. Credit index. Sanders Financial has purchased the ETF for its clients.""Particularly for retail investors that are either on fixed incomes or fully retired or nearing retirement, corporate bonds can be a good way to bring in some steady interest income without taking on as much volatility in the equity markets,"" Sanders says. ""There's a lot of solid companies that issue corporate debt.""Benefits For BanksFinancial institutions that had been taking a beating over their mortgage losses have been the primary beneficiaries of the Fannie-Freddie bailout, although their shares were mostly lower in Tuesday trading after huge gains the day before.Lenders have posted more than $500 billion in credit losses and writedowns during the credit crunch as foreclosures have hit record levels in some areas and property values have tumbled.""Banks had been a little over $40 billion under water relative to their book costs for securities overall, and with (Monday's) move and the tightening in mortgages, we estimate that helps bring that to only about $20 billion under water,"" says Matthew Jozoff, head of mortgage strategy at JP Morgan.Real estate investment trusts also have benefited as the veil of uncertainty was removed from the market. The handful of REITs that invest in Fannie and Freddie debt had ""outperform"" ratings reaffirmed by a KBW analyst after the bailout took hold.""There has been a lot of demand on the sidelines, and this brings clarity to bring those buyers off the sidelines,"" says Michael Hough, chairman and CEO of Hatteras Financial .Hatteras shattered quarterly earnings expectations and on Monday posted its highest single-day gain in nearly three months. -- Reuters contributed to this report.",12:40.5

A huge difference,"" he said.Stamos also pointed to efforts like the election integrity site EI Partnership, with which he works. But making sure voters get the elections information they need to make informed decisions is being made harder by the threat from within our own borders.""The most important disinformation this cycle is coming from domestic sources, and that is huge problem for technology companies,"" Stamos said. ""They are loathe to wade into democratic processes in the U.S.""""It's wonderful tech companies have war rooms and counter disinformation efforts, but we also need to see leadership from the federal government, but we're seeing the federal government sowing misinformation, spreading misinformation, and it's very significant in terms of causing nervousness and lack of confidence in the voting process,"" said Alexis Wichowski, Deputy CTO for Innovation, New York City Mayor's Office of the CTO, who spoke on the CNBC TEC virtual summit with Stamos.The former Facebook security chief said the collaboration between tech platforms and units within the federal government, such as the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which didn't exist in 2016, as well as offensive operations from the military's Cyber Command, are working against the foreign disinformation.""But at the same time, there is election disinformation out of the White House, out of the Twitter account of the president himself and then also from theses influencers around him trying to amplify election disinformation,"" Stamos said. ""I'm not sure we have a good solution between now and Election Day.""He used an early claim of victory in the president election as an example of why censorship won't work.Claims made online can be labeled or taken down, but if President Trump goes to a White House podium and declares victory, it will be covered by every major news organization.""There is only so much they can do if the president gets on a podium of the White House. ... that is newsworthy and will be run on TV and everywhere and they can't censor it.""This week, the top executives from the biggest tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and Alphabet, were grilled by Senate Republicans over claims of bias.President Trump has railed against technology companies and signed an executive order last May targeting Twitter and others after the social media company fact-checked some of his tweeted claims, which he called ""censorship.""The Senate hearing was focused on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, and threats to alter the Act as a response to social media company actions. Facebook and Twitter recently limited access to a New York Post story claiming corrupt actions involving Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, which Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said was the wrong move.""Section 230 is one of the most understood laws about the internet and cited by everyone as too important, and cause of lots of behavior. But the truth is the vast majority of stuff people don't like online is protected under the First Amendment,"" Stamos said.What technology companies can do, Stamos said, is add context, like news organizations would, and he said that makes more sense than trying to block claims entirely.In the end, Stamos said individuals need to make sure they are very careful about what they look at, and where they get information online, and rely on state and local election officials and authorities, of which there are roughly 8,000 in the U.S., and get information on voting directly from them.They may even turn to non-traditional sources of information online, and given the situation, Wichowski said that is a reasonable option. ""In the absence of leadership from the White House or confusing leadership messaging from all levels of government, people look to whomever they can trust,"" Wichowski said.That can even include celebrities and social media influencers, she added, ""if they don't trust elected officials. ... can't just rely on traditional sources of power.""The New York City technology officer said one thing citizens should not worry about is the processing of ballots. ""From an election perspective, decentralization is a strength. It may take more time to process ballots, but we want to protect system integrity from outside actors and each region and district have a solid handle on their own slice of the pie, and decentralization is the way to go about it.""Stamos said after Election Day, one major issue a new Congress should take up is how to structure more federal support for local agencies to make sure disinformation is not promulgated by politicians.",12:40.6
577,Why one analyst thinks Netflix will rise another 67% in the next few years,2017-05-26T11:00:00+0000,Alex Rosenberg,"Soaring shares of  are set to stream even higher, according to Rob Sanderson, a research analyst who covers the stock for MKM Partners.Ahead of Thursday's bell, Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the then-$158 stock to $195. His bullish report appeared to put a bit more wind in Netflix's sails, as the tech giant rose a bit more than 3 percent in the session to close at $163. But if the analyst is right in his long-term call, the stock has even more substantial gains ahead than his current price target implies.To be sure, his target change did not rest on any massive reworking of expectations. Actually, the methodology that leads to his $195 price is almost pleasantly clinical.More from CNBC:Chart points to another 19% rally for Netflix, says top technicianAnalyst predicts a 50 percent crash for Netflix - but admits: 'It is likely that we will be wrong for a while'How one trader plans to make a 300% profit on NetflixSanderson continues to expects the stock to earn $12.12 per share in 2021, and to trade at a forward price target of 22.5 in 2020 — leading to an expectation that the stock will trade at $273 in two and a half years' time. He expects investors to ""discount"" this price by 25 percent for every year in the future it is (as a way to be compensated for the risk of Netflix not achieving those earnings and/or multiple).At the end of January, when Sanderson slapped his prior one-year price target on the stock, one year from then was about two years away from 2020 — so $273 was divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the second power. Now, a year from now is about a year and a half from 2020, so $273 is divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the 1.5st power. Hence the price target moves from $175 to $195.This simple arithmetic can cause one to forget the fact Sanderson is forecasting that Netflix's earnings will explode from about $0.50 in 2016 to more than $12 in five years' time. And to further forecast that even after the stock does so, investors will still be sufficiently optimistic about future profits to slap a high earnings multiple on the company.Sanderson said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that the company has ""more than ample opportunity to continue to scale up [its] content investment on a global basis,"" and that ""the subscriber opportunity is sufficiently large.""While some might be tempted to bet against such heady expectations, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management uses the harshest language to warn against doing so.""I've seen a lot of really good investors lose a great amount of money on stocks like Netflix, and that usually comes from when they short them,"" Davitt said Thursday on ""Power Lunch."" ""It's a momentum stock.""However, Davitt says it would be prudent for Netflix investors to buy a downside put on the stock, in order to maintain their upside while protecting themselves from the potential for great downside.""I think Rob's right, personally,"" he said. ""But if Rob's not right, it costs you 5 percent to own the 'insurance policy' on the stock.""Netflix is up more than 30 percent year-to-date.","cnbc, Articles, Investment strategy, Technology, Investing, Trading Nation, Special Reports, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Soaring shares of  are set to stream even higher, according to Rob Sanderson, a research analyst who covers the stock for MKM Partners.Ahead of Thursday's bell, Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the then-$158 stock to $195.

Actually, the methodology that leads to his $195 price is almost pleasantly clinical.More from CNBC:Chart points to another 19% rally for Netflix, says top technicianAnalyst predicts a 50 percent crash for Netflix - but admits: 'It is likely that we will be wrong for a while'How one trader plans to make a 300% profit on NetflixSanderson continues to expects the stock to earn $12.12 per share in 2021, and to trade at a forward price target of 22.5 in 2020 — leading to an expectation that the stock will trade at $273 in two and a half years' time. He expects investors to ""discount"" this price by 25 percent for every year in the future it is (as a way to be compensated for the risk of Netflix not achieving those earnings and/or multiple).At the end of January, when Sanderson slapped his prior one-year price target on the stock, one year from then was about two years away from 2020 — so $273 was divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the second power. Now, a year from now is about a year and a half from 2020, so $273 is divided by 1 plus 25 percent, raised to the 1.5st power. Hence the price target moves from $175 to $195.This simple arithmetic can cause one to forget the fact Sanderson is forecasting that Netflix's earnings will explode from about $0.50 in 2016 to more than $12 in five years' time. And to further forecast that even after the stock does so, investors will still be sufficiently optimistic about future profits to slap a high earnings multiple on the company.Sanderson said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that the company has ""more than ample opportunity to continue to scale up [its] content investment on a global basis,"" and that ""the subscriber opportunity is sufficiently large.""While some might be tempted to bet against such heady expectations, Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management uses the harshest language to warn against doing so.""I've seen a lot of really good investors lose a great amount of money on stocks like Netflix, and that usually comes from when they short them,"" Davitt said Thursday on ""Power Lunch."" ""It's a momentum stock.""However, Davitt says it would be prudent for Netflix investors to buy a downside put on the stock, in order to maintain their upside while protecting themselves from the potential for great downside.""I think Rob's right, personally,"" he said. ""But if Rob's not right, it costs you 5 percent to own the 'insurance policy' on the stock.""Netflix is up more than 30 percent year-to-date.",12:40.8

That's the position SimpliVity is in. The Westborough, Massachusetts-based company is a leader in what's known as hyperconverged infrastructure for IT. Read MoreFULL LIST: 2016 DISRUPTOR 50In this case, the customer was Waypoint Capital, who, after using SimpliVity's infrastructure solution at five of its global sites — and being impressed with the results — decided to lead a $175 million round of financing last year. This brings the total amount of funding for the company to $276 million. Other investors include Accel Partners, Charles River Ventures and Meritech.Basically, the company's technology brings the virtual aspects of infrastructure together with the physical, resulting in a single solution for the customer. Simply put, it makes an all-in-one hardware box that combines server, storage and networking into one device. It's not unique, but the company claims it is cheaper and easier to install than competitors.Nearly half of SimpliVity's customers — Major League Baseball, cement maker Humboldt Wedag and Swisscom, among them — come from outside the United States. The company, founded by CEO Doron Kempel, a former Israeli Special Forces operative who earned an MBA from Harvard, has 750 employees in 24 countries and claims it grew its customer base 2.5 times in the past year.","Articles, Technology, CNBC Disruptor 50, Disruptor 50 2016, Special Reports, Investing, source:tagname:CNBC US Source",,12:40.8

It has previously said it wants euro-denominated derivative trading to only take place within the EU, or somewhere with ""equivalent"" regulations.","cnbc, Articles, Banks, Brexit, Financials, Europe News, Derivatives, Politics, source:tagname:CNBC Europe Source","Britain formally left the European Union's trade bloc on Dec. 31, marking a new era for the U.K.-EU relationship.  After months of wrangling, new rules for trade were finally agreed just days before the year-end deadline. But in a document spanning over 1,200 pages, there was very little mention of financial services: a sector which accounts for 7% of the U.K.'s economy and 10% of its tax receipts.  One particular issue that arises is the clearing of euro-denominated derivatives. The size of the European derivatives market topped 680 trillion euros ($834 trillion) in 2019, and the majority of European clearing activity takes place on London-based exchanges such as LCH.So far, the European Securities and Markets Authority has agreed to roll over current clearing arrangements for these derivatives until June 22, giving more time for EU-based institutions to decrease their reliance on the British-based clearers. It has previously said it wants euro-denominated derivative trading to only take place within the EU, or somewhere with ""equivalent"" regulations.The two sides have committed to releasing a memo of understanding within twelve weeks that will give further clarity on these equivalence rules. They are especially important for the financial industry as they enable U.K.-based companies to sell services into Europe, as long as the regulations don't diverge substantially from Brussels.   Douglas Flint, chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen, told CNBC's Squawk Box that there does appear to be ""a general recognition that financial stability is too important to risk by having a clumsy exit.""""There has been a discussion of mutual recognition or equivalence for the last four and a half years, so it would take a fresh approach between the U.K.and EU to agree what is important and how the infrastructure can continue to operate,"" he said on Monday. The current arrangement allows for the EU to withdraw equivalence rights for U.K. institutions with only 30 days' notice, a decision that the U.K. has no right to contest. ""Europe has always been very defensive against external providers, so when the U.K. counts as an external provider it will have to take what it's given,"" Simon Gleeson, partner at Clifford Chance, told CNBC. ""The regulatory response therefore needs to be a cooperative response between national regulators.""  The approach so far has been piecemeal and on a temporary bilateral basis. For instance, Italy on Sunday announced that it is allowing U.K. financial companies to keep operating as they are in the country for another six months.  Leaving it up to each individual regulator to make arrangements has also complicated the setup on the ground. Many U.K-based banks have moved personnel covering the Dutch, French, Spanish and German markets to the continent, while those covering Italian and Scandinavian markets have been able to remain in the U.K.  The loss of ""passporting"" — or the ability to trade freely — post-Brexit also means that the days of financial advisors being able to fly in and out of Europe to operate have come to an end. This has prompted many senior staff to relocate to other European hubs such Frankfurt and Paris, the latter being attractive because of the prospect of lower income taxes. In October, EY estimated that the total number of financial services jobs to have left the country since the Brexit referendum was just over 7,500, an estimate that falls short of the gloomy scenario of hundreds of thousands that was forecast by some think tanks in 2016.  As for bank preparedness, NatWest Chairman Howard Davies told CNBC's Street Signs on Monday that while U.K.-focused banks were largely prepared for a ""hard"" Brexit by setting up subsidiaries on the continent, ""what we can't prepare for is the uncertainty which persists."" ""At the moment we don't know what the future arrangement or the regulation of cross border entities in Europe will be. So there is a limit to what financial institutions can do when there are still very significant moving parts here,"" he added. Long term, industry players are still positive on London's fortunes as a global financial hub, with one hedge fund manager telling CNBC that he would still be willing to back the U.K. as ""our business is largely immune to the changes and most aspects of the City are very reliant on talent, knowledge and relationships and for a lot of reasons this is embedded in the U.K."" Natwest's Davies echoes this view, saying London will remain the largest financial center in Europe for the foreseeable future, but the extent that it can ""retain intra-EU business will depend on the new arrangements on regulatory cooperation and equivalence."" Former trade minister and Senior Advisor at Covington, Francis Maude, agreed. ""London is not just a European financial center but a global center. I hope this will be dealt with in a pragmatic way with regulators operating in a non-political"", he told CNBC last week, concluding that, ""this is not the end of a story, it's the beginning of a different story.""",12:40.9

He eventually ""got the hint,"" she says, though the two still had to work together.""It was one of the more horrifying experiences, because you just don't know how to rectify it,"" she said. ""I did tell colleagues and my immediate boss about it, and they laughed it off and said, 'That's how he is.'

As soon as I'm like, 'Uh, no,' they apologize,"" Jennifer said, adding, ""That's happened quite often, actually.""Legally, in most cases, unwanted comments or inappropriate touching must be continuous for an individual to file a lawsuit. The accusers must also show that the harmful environment was ""severe and pervasive,"" Katz said.One woman who worked at trade associations before joining a large K Street firm says she faced retaliation after coming forward about being harassed by a fellow lobbyist.An outside lobbyist hired by the organization where she worked pushed her against the wall of an elevator and tried to kiss her. Although he pulled back when she told him to stop, he began to send her a stream of text messages talking about how he wanted to be with her and how he was unhappy in his marriage.The lobbyist was close with other men in her office, and after she complained, her boss began to schedule lobbying outings involving things she hated and wouldn't do: golf and cigar smoking.""You don't have to terminate someone, but you can make their workplace a living hell,"" she said.",12:41.0
581,Trump sued by Democratic lawmakers over foreign state payments to his businesses,2017-06-14T04:21:58+0000,,"More than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday, saying he had accepted funds from foreign governments through his businesses without congressional consent in violation of the U.S. Constitution.  The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so.  The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs.  The Constitution's ""foreign emoluments"" clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  ""The president's failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don't know,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: ""President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears he's using his presidency to maximize his profits.""  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to sue president  In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president.  On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said ""partisan politics"" was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials.  Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.  ""But the constitutional provision they're suing to enforce gives them a role in how it's carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument,"" Litman said.

With his inauguration now just hours away, CNBC's Sustainable  Energy is taking a look at how environmental and climate  organizations are assessing his potential impact on the  planet.  Trump's previous statements on the environment and climate change  – many of them via Twitter – have not sat well with  many.   To give just one example, in 2012 he famously described the  concept of global warming as having been ""created by and for the  Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""     Trump has also threatened to pull the U.S. out of the historic  Paris Agreement, reached at the COP21 summit in Paris back in  2015, although he told the New York Times in November that he was  ""going to take a look at it.""   For Ottmar Edenhofer, chief economist at the Potsdam Institute  for Climate Impact Research, there could well be issues  ahead.   ""Trump will have substantial potential to cause trouble on  climate policy,"" Edenhofer said in a statement released on  Thursday, before going on to state that Trump could attempt to  ""drive the export of coal.""   ""The economic policy of the new president could also lead to  rising interest rates, which would compromise the competitiveness  of renewable energies,"" he added.   The profitability of climate-friendly technologies was primarily  determined by investment costs, which are dependent on the interest  rate, Edenhofer added. The actions Trump takes in office with regards to the environment  will impact people living both in the United States and the rest  of the world.   On Friday, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth in  England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was forthright in his  opinion.   ""The battle to prevent the world spinning towards catastrophic  climate change is going to be a tough challenge – and, with  a cheer-leader for the fossil fuel industry sitting in the  Whitehouse, it's going to be tougher still,"" Craig Bennett said  in a statement.

594,Strides in space farming may boost plan to build human colony on Mars,2016-09-29T15:06:17+0000,Jeff Daniels,"Scientists are making strides in growing food in space, and their efforts could  be critical to eventually supporting a permanent human colony  on Mars.""We can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the  atmosphere,"" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday in a  long-awaited speech detailing his vision for sending humans to  Mars by 2025.

Mars would require a six-month journey to  the planet, an 18-month stay and a six-month trip back.","cnbc, Articles, Food and drink, Business, Agriculture, Life, Orbital Sciences Corp, Elon Musk, Food and Beverage, Business News, US: News, Science, Health & Science, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Scientists are making strides in growing food in space, and their efforts could  be critical to eventually supporting a permanent human colony  on Mars.""We can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the  atmosphere,"" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said Tuesday in a  long-awaited speech detailing his vision for sending humans to  Mars by 2025.

Mars would require a six-month journey to  the planet, an 18-month stay and a six-month trip back.  NASA has a stated goal for a manned Mars mission  in the 2030s. The agency is studying the effects of long-duration  space exploration on astronauts as well as learning how to best  grow vegetables or other plants aboard a spacecraft or on Mars.  The tests on plants, part of NASA's ""Veggie"" program, have been conducted in a pressurized space garden aboard  the International Space Station as well as in terrestrial laboratories.  At present, red romaine lettuce is the only food grown in space  that NASA has approved for astronaut consumption. The lettuce's antioxidant properties could reduce the consequences  of humans getting radiation exposure in space. Researchers also are  testing cabbage and peppers.""For the astronauts to grow a portion of their food to augment  their diet with fresh, nutritious food, I think would be a  tremendous benefit and savings overall,"" said Trent Smith, Veggie project manager at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. He  said the cost and weight to deliver food to Mars ""is pretty  significant"" and indicated that plants could also grow aboard the  spacecraft on the long journey to Mars.  In recent years, NASA has relied on private companies such as  SpaceX, Orbital Sciences and others to resupply the Space Station  with a cargo load of supplies, including freeze-dried food that has a long shelf life. These cargo  deliveries have taken place roughly around every three months, but  when astronauts go outside of low Earth orbit in long duration  missions on Mars, it will not be practical to resupply missions  every few months.  Musk this week estimated that a one-way trip to Mars for one person would cost  about $10 billion and indicated there were ways to reduce that cost drastically by refilling the spaceship tanks in orbit. He also  talked about the need to build a methane-based propellant production plant on  Mars for the spaceships.  The methane could be created through the extraction of ice water  on Mars and combining it with the planet's abundant carbon dioxide.  Having the local propellant source and fresh food production could go a long way to creating a self-sustaining colony on the Red Planet located 33.9 million miles from Earth.  Moreover, chemical plants could use some of the compounds found  on Mars to create plastics that might be used to build shelters,  greenhouses, vehicles and high-tech potting systems for growing  food.  ""On Mars it will be easier to grow plants, and we can use a lot of  advanced hydroponics and aeroponics systems that we currently  have on Earth and grow plants in lava tubes or any other place  where we can keep an atmosphere,"" said Robert Ferl, a professor  of Horticultural Sciences at the University of Florida in  Gainesville. Both hydroponic and aeroponic gardening can be done  without any soil.  The surface gravity on Mars is about one-third of that on Earth, but that is not a major concern when it comes to growing plants.  The same cannot be said for growing plants aboard the Space  Station in microgravity, where it's a challenge getting the  air and water mixture just right for the plant's roots.Plants under zero gravity conditions  can suffer from either flood or droughts since there's no natural  convection and the water can stick around the roots or edges of  the pot.One way around the microgravity is to use a pillow-like  technology developed by NASA. Seed and soil-like  particles are put into the pillow chamber where they can be more efficiently controlled in zero gravity conditions to support plant growth.  ""Turns out that managing water and managing fluids, especially  around the roots of plants, is fairly tricky stuff in the absence  of gravity,"" said Ferl, who has conducted NASA-funded experiments  on plants.  Space agriculture, whether aboard the space station or in an  extraterrestrial habitat, can provide food and recycling benefits  for crews. The plants recycle the astronaut's exhaled carbon  dioxide and also can use the excreted water. LED lights are used  for sunlight to increase the photosynthetic activity by the  plants.  The public's awareness of the possibilities of space farming may  be limited to what they saw in the 2015 Hollywood blockbuster  movie ""The Martian,"" starring Matt Damon. His character is a  botanist who gets stranded on the planet and grows food to  survive using Martian soil mixed with a fertilizer made of human  manure.  Experts say there's some truth in the movie but suggest using  untreated human excrement as a fertilizer on Mars would be  dangerous. They also suggest that the Martian soil contains toxic  elements that also would need to be removed.  ""Matt Damon would have had to clean the soil a little bit and  remove all these toxic things before using it to grow plants,""  said Lucie Poulet, who has conducted research simulating Martian  soil. She recently published a space agriculture research paper  in Botany Letters with colleagues from France's  University Blaise Pascal.Astronaut Mark Watney, Damon's character in the movie, harvested  Martian potatoes. Turns out potatoes and sweet potatoes are on  the list of vegetables that could be grown in space, according to  NASA. Tomatoes, wheat and soybeans also have been mentioned by  plant researchers as a crop that offers the potential for space  gardens in the future.  Tomato seeds were tested aboard space shuttle missions but didn't  produce fruit as it would have required pollination. Some have  raised the possibility of sending bees or other insects into  space to pollinate plants in space gardens, although there are  other solutions.  ""The astronauts are going to have to become the bees for the  testing,"" said NASA's plant expert Smith. ""My hope is we'll be  able to do some of this robotically. There's no reason why you  can't have a robotic system with sensors to cross-pollinate the  plants.""   For deep space travelers, growing plants isn't just a source of  food but could have less obvious benefits, too. Caring for plants  could offer a psychological boost as astronauts go to Mars and  see the Earth getting smaller and smaller.  ""Having that little piece of Earth while they're on the journey  to Mars to remind them of the smells and the sights of home will  be very important,"" said Smith.",12:42.9

Pyramid Brewing, located across the street from the Safeco, even  goes so far as to use its craft cart as a laboratory of sorts,  brewing 25-barrel test batches of beer and selling it at its  craft cart to gauge customer reaction.While that type of attention is enough to win over most beer  fans, Dishington joked not every fan is convinced the Safeco beer  selection is a home run.""You look at our list and it seems massive, but because there so  many local options in this market, we still have people  complaining we don't have their particular favorite!"" he laughed.  -By CNBC's Tom Rotunno; Follow him on Twitter @TomRotunno Questions?

597,"Gundlach: Gold is going to $1,500",2014-06-12T22:09:19+0000,Lawrence Lewitinn,"It's one thing to say gold is going higher. But, when Jeffrey  Gundlach, manager of the $49 billion DoubleLine, says he thinks  gold will hit $1,500 per ounce by the end of this year, that's  something people pay attention to.  In a webcasted presentation called ""Penny For Your Thoughts"",  Gundalch noted the 96 percent reduction in the U.S. dollar's  purchasing power since the Federal Reserve Bank was established a  century ago, likening the end of the gold standard to the silver  debasement of the Roman denarius from 64 to 270 AD. During the  question and answer period, Gundlach said he thought gold could  move to $1,500 this year.  The last time gold was at $1,500 was in April, 2013. Gold traded  at $1,260 per ounce on Wednesday.  (Watch: Stocks slide; worst hit in 3  weeks for Dow, S&P 500)  ""Of course, there's a chance [Gundlach] could be right and gold  could go higher,"" said Richard Ross, global technical strategist  at Auerbach Grayson. ""But, there's very little in the short-term  technicals to suggest that move has begun in earnest.""  Gold has been trading in a range between $1,180 and $1,400 for  much of the past year, notes Ross. For the short-term, he is  keeping an eye on the $1,270 line, which is close to the current  150-day moving average. ""A break back above that level could set  us up for a retest of that resistance around 1,400,"" said Ross.  However, that range should be seen in the context of the  longer-term chart, according to Ross, a ""Talking Numbers""  contributor. ""We're still in a downtrend from the highs that we  established back around 1,900,"" he said.  Ross sees gold's break below its 150-week moving average as  technically significant. Since the start of 2013, the 150-week  moving average has been relatively flat, near the $1,525 level.  ""You've got to get through 1,400 before you can trade 1,500,  clearly,"" said Ross.

Gina Sanchez, founder of Chantico Global, said that while there's  a possibility that gold could go higher, she thinks the chances  are low. The World Bank's reduction of global growth from 3.2  percent to 2.8 percent may cause some flight-to-safety buying of  bullion. And, global interest rates are low, which traditionally  augurs well for the yellow metal. But, Sanchez believes that  won't last.  (Watch: World Bank: 'Now is the time  to prepare for next crisis')  ""Even though we're in a benign interest rate environment in the  U.S. – and certainly within Europe and Japan – I do  think that in the U.S., rates will likely start to trend higher  by the end of the year or into 2015,"" said Sanchez, a CNBC  contributor.

The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness.This summer, Adam Glass — who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives — testified in a deposition about Goldman’s Abacus, a mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail.It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanup, he helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess.For many years, Mr. Glass served as the outside counsel to Paulson & Company, the giant New York hedge fund firm run by John Paulson, who made billions betting against the housing market. And yes, Mr. Glass, in that role, signed off on Abacus, which was created specifically for the hedge fund to short subprime mortgages. Mr. Paulson handpicked some of the underlying investments in the derivative.The government, in its complaint, claimed that Goldman had “misstated and omitted key facts regarding” Abacus, including disclosing Mr. Paulson’s role in its creation. The firm paid $550 million to settle the case, without admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Paulson was never accused of any wrongdoing.Mr. Glass’s recent deposition was for a separate S.E.C. case against Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader who had developed and marketed Abacus to investors. Mr. Tourre, 31, has denied the accusations.The revelation of Mr. Glass’s involvement in the Abacus deal could undermine the S.E.C.’s case — or at least prove to be a distracting embarrassment.Perhaps more important, his role once again raises questions about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street at a time when public distrust about the agency and its lack of enforcement action against the culprits of the crisis is running high.“There are a lot of talented people out there you could hire who weren’t necessarily part of the problem,” said Mary Kreiner Ramirez, a professor at Washburn University School of Law. “If he was involved in Abacus, how is he supposed to police it?”It is a common question as the government increasingly looks to fill its ranks with regulatory officials proficient in the language of Wall Street. Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, was previously the general counsel of Deutsche Bank. The agency tapped Eileen Rominger, the former global chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, as its director of investment management.“The revolving door is such a dominant fact about the S.E.C.’s culture,” said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor. “You get people who go to Washington for one to three years and then go back to Wall Street.”The pattern has been well documented. According to the Project on Government Oversight, 219 former S.E.C. staff members filed 789 “postemployment statements indicating their intent to represent an outside client before the commission” from 2006 to 2010. In other words, the one-time government officials are representing Wall Street clients with matters before the agency.While clearly there are questions about whether the public wants someone in government who just came from industry, the opposite argument can be made, too: It may be better to have the fox in the henhouse.President Franklin D. Roosevelt “justified appointing Joe Kennedy as chairman of the S.E.C. with the line: ‘You need to set a thief to catch a thief,’ ” said Professor Coffee. “That is the case for bringing in an industry expert.”After all, the best way for the government to stay ahead of financial innovations — or at least not fall too far behind — is to employ people who know them best.After the government’s bailout of A.I.G. , some said the insurer should keep paying bonuses to employees, as they were among the few who understood how to unwind some of the company’s complex trades.Mr. Glass, who has long advocated more regulation of derivatives in certain instances, came to the S.E.C. with a strong finance pedigree. A graduate of Harvard and of Stanford Law School, Mr. Glass was a partner at Linklaters, where he founded the firm’s structured finance and derivatives practice.In addition to Paulson & Company, he counted Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers among his top clients. Mr. Glass was not involved in the controversial opinion that Linklaters issued to Lehman about a practice known as Repo 105 that has come under scrutiny. The tactic allowed Lehman to conceal billions of dollars on its balance sheet.Mr. Glass took a big pay cut to become a civil servant. The average Linklaters partner made about $2.3 million in 2008, the year before he left, according to Legal Week, an industry publication. The most Mr. Glass could make at the S.E.C. is $233,000.When I asked Mr. Glass about his deposition in the Tourre case and his role as the lawyer for Mr. Paulson in the Abacus transaction, he said, “Yes, that would be true.” He then directed me to the S.E.C.’s spokesman, who quickly issued a “no comment.” Spokesmen for Mr. Tourre and Mr. Paulson also declined to comment.Mr. Glass was involved in reviewing the Abacus deal. He reviewed and commented on an “engagement letter” between Goldman and ACA, the firm that insured the deal, said three people with knowledge of his testimony and e-mails. He also received a draft copy of the “offering circular” and term sheet provided to outside investors, but those documents did not include disclosures about how Mr. Paulson’s firm had selected certain mortgage-backed securities for the investment vehicle that he was betting against. The offering circular stated that ACA would select the initial portfolio.The potential obfuscation of Mr. Paulson’s role is at the center of the case against Mr. Tourre. Mr. Glass, who testified that he did not recall seeing the offering document, did not ask for additional disclosure about Mr. Paulson’s role or comment on the disclosure language, said the people briefed on his deposition. But Mr. Glass had no legal duty to Goldman’s clients.Mr. Glass worked with Mr. Paulson’s firm to help structure similar mortgage deals, and in one instance he pushed for additional disclosures. On a Deutsche Bank derivatives deal, Mr. Glass suggested that the bank might want to include more explicit disclosure language for its clients, according to a person briefed on the deal. Deutsche Bank did not take Mr. Glass’s advice.In the end, Mr. Glass is tangential to the S.E.C.’s case against Mr. Tourre. But he is a central example in the age-old debate about the benefits and costs of Washington’s revolving door.“I don’t think Mr. Glass has done anything unethical in helping Mr. Paulson structure this product,” Professor Coffee said.“But it is a case that will raise further questions about the S.E.C.”",12:43.7
603,"Self-driving trucks are here, but they won’t put truck drivers out of work — yet",2016-12-20T14:38:49+0000,,"Self-driving trucks are here. Otto, a self-driving  truck startup that Uber acquired this summer, shipped a truckload of  Anheuser-Busch beer across Colorado. According to  Otto's blog post on the trip,  ""our professional driver was out of the driver's seat for the  entire 120-mile journey down I-25, monitoring the self-driving  system from the sleeper berth in the back.""  But this doesn't mean the nation's truck drivers need to start  working on their résumés.

Lee:  This is Facebook's plan to fight  fake news  Interest rate hikes slow the economy. So why did the Fed  just announce one? Automationis inevitable. Here's how to make sure we create jobs, not justdestroy them. The key reason is that Otto's self-driving technology is  initially limited to highways. When the truck reaches ordinary  city streets, it hands control over to a human driver to handle  tricky traffic situations. This means that even after a truck is  outfitted with Otto's self-driving technology, it will still need  a human driver in the truck.","makeit, Articles, Make It, Make It - Entrepreneurs , Make It - Money, Technology, Make It - Work, Make It - Careers, source:tagname:Vox",,12:43.8

Walgreens also has a home delivery program.The intensifying spat over transfers offers a window into the larger challenge Amazon faces as it tries to mimic its e-commerce playbook in the prescription medication world, where spending in the U.S. is approaching $500 billion a year. The company is already battling Surescripts, an e-prescribing network part-owned by CVS and Express Scripts, over a patient data dispute. Last month, Surescripts threatened to cut off a contract with a third party called ReMy Health, which gave PillPack access to data about patient prescription histories, and said it would turn the case over to the FBI.CVS says it's not indiscriminately rejecting transfer orders, but rather is calling patients when a request is submitted to make sure the customer has asked for it. Many of these patients are older and unfamiliar with the new world of online shopping and mobile apps.The pharmacies say they're only denying transfers when patients tell them they never signed up for PillPack or have never even heard of it. The issue can be particularly challenging for people with dementia who may not have intended to sign up or not remembered doing so. Brian Caswell, the owner of Wolkar Drug in Kansas, said he's called patients about PillPack requests only to have them deny ever providing consent.""Could they have clicked on something online and forgot about it?"" Caswell said. ""It's possible.""There could also be patients who did request a transfer to PillPack but are embarrassed to admit it when their pharmacist calls for confirmation.The fight with the big pharmacies began almost immediately after Amazon announced the PillPack acquisition in June 2018, for $753 million (though the price wasn't disclosed until later). A month after the deal, CVS sent a cease-and-desist letter to PillPack's lawyers, and Walgreens sent a strongly-worded warning in August, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not be named because the letters were confidential.Both CVS and Walgreens confirmed that they reached out to PillPack but didn't specify the exact nature of the correspondence.""We've communicated our concerns directly to PillPack,"" a Walgreens spokesperson said. ""We respect our patients' privacy rights, and strongly believe that patients are entitled to, and benefit from a personal and trusted relationship with their pharmacist.""A CVS spokesperson said that while it's ""common practice"" for pharmacists to legitimately request prescription transfers from its pharmacies, the company ""notified PillPack to stop any activity to initiate prescription transfers without the informed consent of our pharmacy patients.""PillPack responded at the time to both CVS and Walgreens, denying that the company was doing anything wrong.Here's how a transfer works. A CVS or Walgreens customer sees a PillPack ad on television or online and pulls up the PillPack website or calls a company representative. By phone, PillPack says, patients are asked explicitly if they give the company consent to transfer prescriptions from their current pharmacy. From the website, the patient fills out personal information, includes relevant prescriptions and then clicks a blue button to complete the signup.Just below the blue button, here's what the fine print says:""By clicking the 'Finish Signing Up' button above, you consent to PillPack transferring your prescriptions from your existing pharmacies to PillPack and/or contacting your doctors to request new prescription and refills.""From there, a PillPack representative calls or faxes the existing pharmacy and requests the transfer. It's a straightforward process that happens all the time when patients move or when they're traveling and need to pick up a refill before returning home. In the U.S., there are federal and state laws that, with some exceptions, require pharmacists to transfer prescription information to another pharmacy.However, PillPack said its pharmacists began reporting challenges with patient transfer requests in the weeks after the acquisition was announced. Additionally, the company said it heard reports in July 2018, that CVS hosted a training session for pharmacists, informing them that they should not transfer to PillPack until after they notified patients about the company's rival service.CVS told CNBC that, starting last year, it recommended its pharmacists check in with customers following a PillPack transfer request after hearing a series of complaints about the company's practices. CVS also said representatives tell customers about the company's own mail-order service but that its pharmacies will facilitate a transfer to PillPack if the patient still wants it.CVS and Walgreens aren't the only pharmacies concerned about PillPack's actions. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents U.S. pharmacy owners and is one of the owners of Surescripts, said his team has heard from 20 to 30 pharmacists who said they were concerned after patients told them they never authorized transfers to PillPack. Pharmacists have also been vocal on internet forum Reddit, where in several threads some have admitted that they automatically throw PillPack faxes ""in the shred bin,"" or call patients to get confirmation.Update: This story was updated to say that the National Community Pharmacists Association is a part owner of Surescripts.WATCH: How Amazon could change the pharmacy businessFollow @CNBCtech on Twitter for the latest tech industry news.",12:44.1

Nigeria, Senegal  and now the United States - where the first case was diagnosed on  Tuesday in a man who flew in from Liberia - have all seen people  carrying the Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, apparently  unwittingly, arrive on their shores.  France is among countries most likely to be hit next because the  worst affected countries include Guinea, alongside Sierra Leone  and Liberia, which is a French-speaking country and has busy  travel links back, while Britain's Heathrow airport is one of the  world's biggest travel hubs.   France and Britain have each treated one national who was brought  home with the disease and then cured. The scientists' study  suggests that more may bring it to Europe not knowing they are  infected.    ""If this thing continues to rage on in West Africa and indeed  gets worse, as some people have predicted, then it's only a  matter of time before one of these cases ends up on a plane to  Europe,"" said Gatherer.  Read MoreEbola patient in US takes turn  for the worse  Belgium has a 40 percent chance of seeing the disease arrive on  its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14  percent each, according to the study first published in the  journal PLoS Current Outbreaks and now being regularly updated at  http://www.mobs-lab.org/ebola.html.   The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not placed any  restrictions on travel and has encouraged airlines to keep flying  to the worst-hit countries.  and Emirates airlines have suspended  some flights.  But the risks change every day the epidemic continues, said Alex  Vespignani, a professor at the Laboratory for the Modeling of  Biological and Socio-Technical Systems at Northeastern University  in Boston who led the research.   ""This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities - but  those probabilities are growing for everyone,"" Vespignani said in  a telephone interview. ""It's just a matter of who gets lucky and  who gets unlucky.""    The latest calculations used data from October 1. Read MoreDeadly Ebola virus spreads—and so do fears  ""Air traffic is the driver,"" Vespignani said. ""But there are also  differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea,  Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases  in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability  numbers change.""  Patients unaware  Patients are at their most contagious when Ebola is in its  terminal stages, inducing both internal and external bleeding,  and profuse vomiting and diarrhoea - all of which contain high  concentrations of infectious virus.      But the disease can also have a long incubation period of up to  21 days, meaning that people can be unaware for weeks that they  are infected, and not feel or display any symptoms.    This, it seems, is what allowed the Liberian visitor Thomas Eric  Duncanto to fly to the United States and spend several days there  unaware that he was carrying the deadly virus, before being  diagnosed and isolated.  In the European Union, free movement of people means someone  unknowingly infected with Ebola could easily drive through  several neighbouring countries before feeling ill and seeking  help, and spend weeks in contact with friends or strangers before  becoming sick enough to show up on airport scanners.        Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's  Nottingham University said that even with exit screening at  airports of affected countries, the long, silent incubation  period meant ""cases can slip through the net"".  Read MoreUS health system will 'stop'  Ebola: WH officials  ""Whilst the risk of imported Ebola virus remains small, it's  still a very real risk, and one that won't go away until this  outbreak is stopped,"" he said. ""Ebola virus isn't just an African  problem.""   However, the chance of the disease spreading widely or developing  into an epidemic in a wealthy, developed country is extremely  low, healthcare specialists say.   According to the latest Ebola risk assessment from the European  Centres of Disease Prevention and Control, which monitors health  and disease in the region, ""the capacity to detect and confirm  cases...is considered to be sufficient to interrupt any possible  local transmission of the disease early.""   Gatherer cited Nigeria as an example of how Ebola can be halted  with swift and detailed action.  Read MoreEbola: A closer look at this 'frightening disease'  Despite being in West Africa and being home to one of the world's  most crowded, chaotic cities, Nigeria has managed to contain  Ebola's spread to a total of 20 cases and 8 deaths, and looks  likely to be declared free of the virus in coming weeks.   ""Even if we have a worse case scenario where someone doesn't  present for medical treatment, or..it's not correctly identified  as Ebola, and we get secondary transmission, it's not likely to  be a very long secondary transmission chain,"" he said.   ""People aren't living in very crowded conditions (in Europe), so  the disease doesn't have the same environment it has in a shanty  town in Monrovia, where the environment is perfect for it to  spread.

Sort of like how Apple sells a $5,999 Mac Pro for people who want the best Mac Apple makes.Here's a look at the AirPods Max:This case serves a purpose, though. It has magnets inside so that when you put the AirPods Max in it they automatically go into low power mode to help save battery life. I agree with the critics. It looks a little weird.I wore the AirPods Max for several hours Wednesday and they felt super comfortable. There's a breathable mesh band on the top that felt light on my head and didn't get sweaty or hot. I also love the ear cups, which are spacious and fit around my ears instead of sitting on them.There are a lot of high-end touches, like aluminum cups and a steel frame, instead of plastic parts you might find in competing headsets. I also dig the Digital Crown that Apple brought over from the Apple Watch. It feels solid and turns easily to adjust the volume. A lot of competing high-end headphones use touch controls for volume, which isn't as accurate as a physical control.The AirPods Max are just as easy as other AirPods to set up. That's important, since it's one of the reasons the AirPods are so successful. You just turn the AirPods Max on, bring your iPhone or iPad nearby, and tap a pop-up that says ""connect."" That's it. There's no need to poke through your Bluetooth settings for the connection.I like that it's easy to switch between an iPhone, Mac or iPad, too. But, they don't have a 3.5 mm headphone jack so you'll need to buy an adapter and a cord if you want to use them with non-Bluetooth devices.You don't need an Apple gadget to use the AirPods Max. They'll connect to Android phones, Windows PCs and other devices like any other Bluetooth headset.They sound really good to me. I'll revisit more in my full review, but I also don't know that I could stand here right now and pinpoint exactly how much better they sound than a pair of Bose or Sony headphones. The noise cancellation is pretty solid: I didn't hear people talking in the room next to me while I was working. I'm not sure how they'll compare on an airplane to Bose yet, though. And I won't be flying anytime soon for obvious reasons.Apple has a few tricks competitors don't have, like Spatial Audio, which makes it sound like noises in a movie are coming from all around you and from the source, like your iPad or iPhone. It's a cool feature Apple recently added to the AirPods Pro.There are lots of sensors, so the headphones pause audio when you take them off, or even when you lift an earcup. That works well.Finally, I tested the microphones with a quick 10-minute call Wednesday. It seemed like the other side heard me just fine, and I could hear them perfectly.The AirPods Max are also pretty big. One of the reasons I love the AirPods Pro so much is that, back when we could travel, I was able to leave my Bose headphones at home and use the noise cancellation in the much smaller earbuds. They just slip in my pocket and I can carry them with me wherever I go. The AirPods Max don't have that convenience. They're still big enough that you'll need a bag to carry them around. But they're perfect at home right now when I'm mostly sitting at my computer most of the day.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",12:44.4
608,What's Wrong With Simon Johnson? ,2011-01-28T18:32:12+0000,John Carney,"Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the IMF who is now a leading financial commentator at Baseline Scenario, is one of the more prominent critics of the view that blame for the financial crisis falls on affordable housing and fair lending policies. The problem is that his critique is extremely misguided.","cnbc, Articles, CNBC EVENTS, NetNet, source:tagname:CNBC US Source","Simon Johnson, the former chief economist of the IMF who is now a leading financial commentator at Baseline Scenario, is one of the more prominent critics of the view that blame for the financial crisis falls on affordable housing and fair lending policies. The problem is that his critique is extremely misguided. Let's take this recent column Johnson wrote for Project Syndicate. Johnson begins by attempting to summarize the view that, for example, FCIC commissioner Peter Wallison appears to hold. In December, the Republican minority on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), weighed in with a preemptive dissenting narrative. According to this group, misguided government policies, aimed at increasing homeownership among relatively poor people, pushed too many into taking out subprime mortgages that they could not afford. But this isn't quite right. What Wallison argues is that GSEs and banks lowered credit standards and accumulated huge mortgage holdings in an effort to comply with misguided government policies. Shortly after making that mistake, Johnson restates what he takes to be Wallison's point in a way that demonstrates that he doesn't really understand it at all. (Emphasis mine.) This narrative has the potential to gain a great deal of support, particularly in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election. But, while the FCIC Republicans write eloquently, do they have any evidence to back up their assertions? Are poor people in the US responsible for causing the most severe global crisis in more than a generation? It is very difficult to see how that last question follows from anything that came before it. The proposition that the financial crisis was brought about by government policies aimed at increasing homeownership among the poor has no logical connection at all to the culpability of the poor for the crisis. This is easy to understand if we think of other types of misguided government regulations. Take, for example, the regulation of fishing. For years, it has been common practice for regulations to set minimum sizes for fish that can be taken. The idea is to allow fish a chance to mature enough to breed at least once, in hopes that this will keep the population robust. For individual fishermen, this usually means just throwing back a fish that is too small. For large commercial fishermen, however, this involves using fishing techniques that allow smaller fish to escape their nets and traps. Now the purpose of this kind regulation is to preserve the fish population. A recent study, however, indicates that this kind of selective fishing might have the perverse effect of reducing the biodiversity of the fish population and making it more fragile and prone to collapse in the face of unexpected changes. In 2010, a team of researchers wrote: “We believe it is time to critically rethink traditional selective fishing approaches that might not protect ecosystems and fisheries as intended, but may in fact make them more vulnerable to large changes in structure and function.”Now according to Johnsons logic, if we say that a regulation intended to protect smaller fish from harvesting causes the ecosystem to become more vulnerable we are also claiming that small fish are responsible for harming the ecosystem. Clearly, that's nonsense. In the same way, it is simply nonsensical to equate blaming affording housing and fair lending policies for the crisis with blaming the poor. Of course the poor are not responsible for the financial crisis. And the small fish aren't responsible for falling biodiversity. In both cases, misguided regulations are to blame. _________________________________________________Questions? Comments?

612,Amazon gives shoppers a glimpse at its Prime Day deals,2016-06-30T05:00:00+0000,Krystina Gustafson,"Amazon has finally  lifted the lid on its second-annual Prime Day sale, which it's  touting as the ""biggest Amazon event ever.""  On July 12, the online retailer will offer Prime members new  deals as often as every five minutes. That compares with a new  deal every 10 minutes during last year's Prime Day. In all, the  sale will include more than 100,000 deals spanning ""nearly all  departments and categories,"" from televisions to vitamins. Amazon  did not provide a comparable number of items for last year's  event, but said this is the largest number of deals it's offered  in a single day.  The U.S. sale will kick off at 3 a.m. Eastern for existing Prime  members, as well as those who sign up that day for one of its  paid memberships or free 30-day trial. Unlike last year, Amazon  will offer a handful deals for Prime members in the week leading  up to Prime Day, on items including a 32-inch TV bundled with a  Fire TV Stick, which will sell for $119.99.   ""Following last year's record sales, we have dramatically  increased the inventory behind many deals,"" said Greg Greeley,  vice president of Amazon Prime. That includes nearly double the  number of TV units in stock as compared with Black Friday and  Cyber Monday combined. Last year, some shoppers  complained on social media that the deals were selling out too  quickly.  Amazon's Prime Day playbook is similar to its Black Friday  strategy, which also rolled out deals every five minutes. Company  spokeswoman Julie Law said some of the discounts will be deeper than  last year's event.  During its inaugural Prime Day sale, held last July in honor of  the company's 20th anniversary, Amazon sold more units than on  Black Friday 2014, which at the time was its biggest ever  (Amazon's 2015 Black Friday event surpassed that metric). In  addition to driving sales, the event led to more new members  trying Prime than on any day in its history, Amazon said.  Though Amazon does not release information regarding the number  of Prime members, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners  estimates Amazon has 54 million U.S. members. The firm's data also  shows that 73 percent of Amazon's 30-day trial subscribers pay for  the first full year of membership. And 91 percent of first-year  subscribers renew for a second year, CIRP said.  Amazon has not set an explicit goal for this year's event, though the company expects it to be ""another record-breaking  Prime Day,"" Law said. She said additional details regarding specific Prime  Day deals will be released closer to the event, including ""far  more"" limited-time lightning deals and deals of the day. Shoppers last year also grumbled on social media that the discounts were not as deep as they had expected, and that some of the items on sale seemed strange. One deal, for example, promoted a chef's hat.  Law responded to criticism that the Prime Day discounts at times  seem random, saying the event is different from Black Friday in  that it's not a gifting holiday. Instead, it's the time of year  when shoppers are stocking up on such things as seasonal summer  goods and back-to-school essentials, she said.  ""What could be weird to one person may be wonderful to someone  else,"" Law said. ""We really stand behind the deals we had last  year and the deals we have this year.""  Amazon's announcement, while widely expected, comes one day after  Wal-Mart announced  a free 30-day trial  for its ShippingPass service, which is positioned as a  competitor to Prime. Similar to Amazon Prime, Wal-Mart shoppers  can pay an annual fee to receive unlimited two-day  shipping.   Wal-Mart's version of the service costs $49 a year, compared to  $99 for an annual Prime subscription. However, Prime membership  includes additional benefits that aren't part of Wal-Mart's  program, including unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows.

The company said Thursday that it's looking for a new chief executive as it adjusts its business strategy, which is focused on strengthening its financial position. It named its chairman to the top spot until a permanent replacement can be found. E*Trade  has been struggling as individual consumers pull money out of the stock market. The New York company's net income dropped 16 percent in the April to June quarter as investors made far fewer trades than a year ago. Faced with less trading activity, E*Trade said it was focusing on managing costs and dialing back on risk to strengthen earnings. Freiberg, 55, had been at E*Trade's helm for a little more than two years. He was at Citigroup  for 30 years before that, where he most recently led the consumer group that handles individual investments, retail banking, and credit cards. Freiberg was paid a base salary of $1 million a year and was eligible for stock incentives worth up to three times that. He will get an undisclosed severance package. Shares of E-Trade have lost more than half their value in the past year. Adjusting for a stock split, they are down 97 percent from their peak in 2006. The stock was up more than six percent in pre-market trading Thursday. Frank Petrilli, 61, has been E*Trade's chairman since January. He's a long-time financial industry executive.",12:45.4

620,Cash-Hungry States Are Putting Buildings on the Block,2010-05-05T17:16:33+0000,,"Is it better to rent or to own?The default answer for a long time — when real estate’s horizon seemed limitless — was to own. Lately some individuals and businesses have decided that maybe owning is not always better, especially when you have other pressing needs for cash, like paying off your creditors.","cnbc, Articles, Politics, source:tagname:The New York Times","Is it better to rent or to own?The default answer for a long time — when real estate’s horizon seemed limitless — was to own. Lately some individuals and businesses have decided that maybe owning is not always better, especially when you have other pressing needs for cash, like paying off your creditors.Now the idea has spread to some states with serious debt problems. In January the state of Arizona concluded a deal to sell to investors ownership stakes worth a total of $735 million in several state-owned office buildings, arenas and other properties — including the buildings housing both chambers of the State Legislature. Arizona will lease back the property from its new landlords, among them the mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard, for 20 years, after which ownership will revert to the state. Arizona is planning another, smaller round of real estate sales in June. For fiscal 2011, which begins in July, the state is estimated to have a deficit of $3 billion.Although it has been drowned out by hotter issues, like the uproar over the state’s new immigration law, some Arizona politicians have sought to make an issue of the sale-leaseback. Dean Martin, the state’s treasurer and a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor this fall, has derided the sale as a one-time gimmick used to circumvent the state’s debt limit and avoid the hard choices he contends Arizona needs to make about what he calls “unsupportable spending.”“How many times can you sell the state capital?” he said.Mr. Martin said he wanted to repackage the state’s debt as bonds and use some of the proceeds to buy back the buildings.“Who wants to make a long-term investment in a state that is renting its Capitol buildings?” he has been asking on the campaign trail.Last month California received sale-leaseback bids on a portfolio of 7.3 million square feet of office space in 11 state-owned buildings. The Golden State Portfolio includes buildings in Los Angeles and Sacramento, as well as the San Francisco Civic Center, where the state Supreme Court sits. The deal had been expected to yield about $660 million in revenue for the state, after $1.1 billion in expected proceeds were used to pay off construction bonds. California’s deficit for 2010-11 is about $20 billion.Kevin Shannon, a vice chairman of the commercial real estate firm CB Richard Ellis, which is managing the auction for the state, said he believed the state would take in more than expected once it analyzed the bids and completed a deal, which is expected to happen by the middle of May. Mr. Shannon said the auction had produced more than 300 bids.“There’s been a lot of press about this being a fire sale,” he said, “but we’re in a competitive bidding situation.” Mr. Shannon said demand for the properties had been greater than expected.As with Arizona’s leaseback, the California auction has become a political football. The state Legislature was almost unanimous in approving the plan a year ago. More recently, however, two members of state real estate boards whose approval was necessary for the sale to proceed say they were abruptly dismissed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because they opposed the deal. They have told reporters they believe it would cost the state more in rent money than it would raise. A state Assembly committee is reviewing the matter.The view that the deal does not make economic sense has been seconded by others, including the state’s independent Legislative Analyst’s Office, which has called the sale “bad budgeting practice.”The leaseback continues to enjoy the support of the governor.“The governor doesn’t believe the state should be in the real estate business,” said Erin Shaw, a spokeswoman for the California Department of General Services, which manages the state’s property holdings. Governor Schwarzenegger said recently that he would not approve a sale if bids were too low. Previously the state shelved a proposed sale of the Orange County fairgrounds when bids came in lower than expected.Besides Arizona and California, only Connecticut is conducting a sale of state office buildings.Connecticut, however, is seeking bids for straight-out purchases of buildings it regards as surplus rather than sale-leasebacks. The comparatively modest properties, which include the Litchfield Jail and the Bristol Armory, have attracted little attention.Gordon F. DuGan, chief executive of W. P. Carey and Company, a real estate investment company that specializes in corporate sale-leaseback deals, said that if the California sale went well other states might follow. Mr. DuGan said, however, that he had not heard of any great interest in such future deals from either prospective buyers or sellers. W. P. Carey has made a bid for some of the California properties, which Mr. DuGan does not expect will be accepted. (The state has said it prefers bidders for the entire package.)Mr. DuGan said bidding for the California property appeared stronger than he had expected, particularly considering that, unlike other sale-leasebacks, the California deal requires buyers to pick up the cost of services like waste hauling and security. He said that structure made the deal more appealing to bidders that, unlike his company, had big operations units.The risk of drawing unwanted headlines by selling state property may be one reason the idea has yet to take hold in other states that are short on money. A few years ago a spurt in the sale of state- and city-owned infrastructure, like highways and bridges, ended amid outrage that some of these properties were being sold to foreign investors.Another reason for the absence of a rush to such deals may be relatively modest proceeds for states. Dan Fasulo, chief of research at Real Capital Analytics, which tracks commercial real estate markets, said in an e-mail message, “There are many states that look at things like this during a crisis, but at the end of the day the amount of money raised from such activities is a laughable amount when viewed from the context of the overall budget shortfalls.”",12:46.0

The national average for self-serve, regular unleaded gasoline rose to $1.7793 on January 9, up some 11.71 cents.And Fast Money’s Joe Terranova thinks prices at the pump are going higher from here. “The crack spread used to be minus 2 dollars, now it’s 7 bucks,” he says.How should you trade it?“The trade is to own the refiners,” counsels Terranova. “Own Valero and Sunoco. They have good balance sheets and are not that reliant on credit.”And it's worth noting, that although gasoline prices are higher, they are still less than half of what consumers paid in July when the average price reached an all-time high of $4.11 a gallon.______________________________________________________Got something to to say?
